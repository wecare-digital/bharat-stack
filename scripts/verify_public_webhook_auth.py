"""Live check: the two public webhook ingresses reject unauthenticated callers.

This is the deployed counterpart to tests/test_public_webhook_auth.py. Unit tests
prove the handler logic; this proves the deployed alias actually enforces it,
which a green test suite cannot.

Every probe is deliberately inert
---------------------------------
  POST /whatsapp/inbound      unsigned, body {}    expect 401
  POST /webhook/sinch-rcs     unsigned, INBOUND    expect 503
  GET  /webhook/sinch-rcs     unsigned             expect 200 (health)

The inbound-shaped Sinch body is the exploit payload: before 2026-09-21 it wrote
a forged message into the canonical MessagesTable and could trigger an outbound
RCS send. It is safe to send now precisely because the fix refuses it before any
parsing or side effect - if this script ever reports 200 for that probe, the
protection has regressed.

Deliberately NOT probed: an unsigned MESSAGE_DELIVERY body. While no webhook
secret is configured at Sinch that type is still processed by design, and
`_process_delivery` issues a DynamoDB update_item, which upserts - so a probe
with a synthetic message id would write a junk row into MessagesTable. Unit
tests cover that path instead.

No credential is sent, because these endpoints require none. That is the point.
