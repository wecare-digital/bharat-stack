"""Deploy wecare-mcp and put it on the apex at https://wecare.digital/mcp

Why this is its own script rather than a Spec in deploy_all_lambdas.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two reasons, and both are structural rather than stylistic.

`config/public-pages.json` has to travel in the zip beside handler.py, and
`deploy_all_lambdas.py` resolves `extra_files` relative to the FUNCTION directory and
skips them entirely for a `standalone=True` spec (see `build_zip`). There is no path
expressible in a Spec that reaches `config/`. The alternatives were a checked-in second
copy of the catalogue inside the function directory, or a symlink - the first is the
exact drift `src/test/PublicAiSurface.test.ts` exists to prevent, and the second breaks
on a Windows checkout. So the packaging lives here, and `deploy_all_lambdas.py` marks
`wecare-mcp` as DELEGATED, the same arrangement `wecare-seo-tools` already has.

Second, `/mcp` needs an Amplify Hosting rewrite as well as an API Gateway route, and
that rewrite is not optional decoration - see below.

THE ROUTING PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, WHICH IS NOT OBVIOUS
-----------------------------------------------------
Amplify Hosting 301-redirects any extension-less path that does not match a rule so as
to add a trailing slash, **and it does so for POST as well as GET**. Measured on the live
site before this script existed:

    $ curl -X POST -D- https://wecare.digital/mcp
    HTTP/2 301
    location: /mcp/

That is fatal for MCP specifically. Every MCP client message is an HTTP POST, and a 301
is not a safe redirect for one: RFC 9110 permits a client to rewrite POST to GET when
following it, and many do, while others refuse to follow a redirect on a non-idempotent
method at all. Either way the handshake never arrives. The endpoint would appear to exist
and simply never work, which is the worst failure shape available.

An explicit rule defeats the normalizer, and that is proven rather than assumed: `/get`
already has `/get` and `/get/` rules at status 200 and returns HTTP 200 with no redirect,
while `/anything-random` 301s. So both `/mcp` and `/mcp/` are registered, pointing at the
same execute-api path.

RULE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING
--------------------------
Amplify evaluates customRules top-down and the last rule is the terminal catch-all
`/<*>` -> `/404.html` at `404-200`. A rule added AFTER it is dead. So these are inserted
immediately BEFORE the catch-all, and the catch-all's position as last is asserted after
the write rather than trusted.

`404-200` is `NOT_FOUND_REWRITE` and is evaluated only once the file lookup misses, which
is why it can sit above nothing and still not shadow the ~123 exported pages. Do not
"fix" it to a plain 200: a 200 on `/<*>` matches unconditionally and would serve the home
page for the entire site.

A NOTE ON scripts/provision_legacy_redirects.py
-----------------------------------------------
That script rebuilds the rule list as `[its own redirects] + [pre-existing non-redirect
rules]`, and recognises a rule as its own only when the source is in its `RETIRED` set.
Its own comments warn that a rule it does not model survives "by luck, not by design".
The `/mcp` rules are status-200 rewrites, so they land in the non-redirect bucket it
preserves - the same bucket that has kept `/api/<*>` and `/get/<*>` alive. That is why
`--verify` exists here: run it after any run of that script.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/deploy_mcp_server.py                # package, deploy, route, rewrite
    python scripts/deploy_mcp_server.py --dry-run      # build and report, change nothing
    python scripts/deploy_mcp_server.py --verify       # check live state, change nothing
    python scripts/deploy_mcp_server.py --verify-live  # public endpoint vs repo, NO credentials
    python scripts/deploy_mcp_server.py --skip-hosting # Lambda + API only

Exit status is 1 when a step fails, or when --verify finds the live state wrong.

`--verify-live` is the one command here that needs no AWS credentials: it POSTs to
https://wecare.digital/mcp and compares the pages it serves with config/public-pages.json.
That is what makes it schedulable - see .github/workflows/mcp-catalogue-drift.yml and the
long note on verify_live() for why a second catalogue check earns its place. It exits 1 on
drift and 3 when the endpoint cannot be read, because a network blip must not look like drift.

    # rather than reading it live, so a catalogue change does not reach it until someone
    # redeploys - and nothing makes them. It happened within hours of the function being
    # created: another session renamed /my-order to /orders, updated the catalogue, the
    # allowlists and the tests, committed, and CI deployed the frontend. wecare-mcp has no
    # CI workflow, so it kept serving the old copy, and `search_pages` handed agents
    # https://wecare.digital/my-order/ - a URL that now 404s. Nothing reported it.
    #
    # Caught here by comparing bytes, so a stale catalogue is a loud verify failure rather
    # than a wrong answer to an agent. scripts/check_deployed_source.py finds the same thing
    # across the whole fleet; this is the function-specific check for the command an operator
    # of THIS function actually runs.
    #
    # The permanent fix is a CI workflow keyed on config/public-pages.json, like
    # seo-tools-deploy.yml. That needs a new OIDC IAM role - the existing
    # GitHubActions-bharat-stack-seo-tools role is scoped to its own function - and creating
    # one is an owner decision under maintenance-reporting. Until then, this check plus
    # `--verify` in the release routine is the guard.

    WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE --verify, WHICH ALREADY CHECKS THE CATALOGUE.
    `--verify` downloads the deployed zip and compares public-pages.json byte for byte. That
    is the stronger check of the two and it stays. But it needs lambda:GetFunction, so it can
    only run on the OIDC read role in public-surface-deploy.yml - a workflow that is
    dispatch-only, has no schedule, and whose role variables this repo cannot confirm are even
    provisioned. The practical consequence was that nothing ran automatically, and the drift
    it describes went unreported until a human thought to look: measured on 2026-09-30, the
    live endpoint was serving 21 pages while the repo had 23, missing /hunar and /vault, three
    hours after the pages merged.

    This check needs no role, no OIDC, and no AWS API at all - only an HTTPS POST to a public
    URL - so it can be scheduled today and cannot sit red for want of an IAM provisioning
    decision. It is also closer to the truth that matters: it reads what a client is actually
    served, rather than what is sitting in a deployment artifact.

    It is weaker in one way and the difference is worth stating: it can only see fields a tool
    exposes. `list_pages` returns path, name, description and group, which is every field the
    catalogue's `pages` entries carry, so for `pages` the two are equivalent. It cannot see
    drift in `usage_terms` or `ai_surface`; `--verify` can. Run both where you can.

    EXIT CODES, and why unreachable is not a failure.
        0  the live catalogue matches the repo
        1  DRIFT - the live catalogue disagrees. A real, actionable finding.
        3  UNREACHABLE - the endpoint could not be read, so NOTHING is known about live
           state. Distinct from 1 on purpose, for the reason recorded in plivo-drift.yml:
           that check once reported a false CRITICAL because a failed credential read and a
           moved invariant shared one exit code. A network blip must not look like drift.
