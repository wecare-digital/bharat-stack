"""PreToolUse guard: refuse any attempt to create an S3 bucket for Blog Production.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT JUST A STEERING RULE.

The steering file states the rule, and a rule in prose is followed by whoever read it. The
project specification names the bucket with a one-character typo (`wecare-difital-get`),
and the single most likely failure mode here is an agent resolving that 404 by helpfully
creating the bucket the name implies - which would produce a second, empty, wrongly-named
storage location that looks correct in logs and holds nothing the application reads.

This refuses instead of asking. Asking is a poor control for unattended work: it blocks
the 999 safe commands and relies on a tired human to catch the one bad one. Same posture as
the three existing deny hooks, and the reason a blanket-allow permissions file is
defensible at all.

It is deliberately HIGH-PRECISION rather than broad. A noisy guard gets switched off, and a
switched-off guard protects nothing. It matches bucket CREATION only, and allows every
read, write, list and policy operation against the existing bucket.

Exit 2 blocks the call and forwards stderr. Exit 0 allows it.

Verify with `python scripts/verify_s3_bucket_hook.py`.
