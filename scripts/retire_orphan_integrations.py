"""Delete API Gateway integrations that no route points at, after exporting them.

What this cleans up
-------------------
Measured 2026-09-28 on HTTP API `zllr9lrg7j`: **112 integrations for 65 routed targets**.
47 had no route attached at all, and four of those pointed at Lambda functions that no
longer exist:

    wecare-outbound-voice        deleted with the voice provider retirement
    wecare-sinch-dlr             Sinch messaging is a PROHIBITED provider here
    wecare-sms-in-airtel         Airtel messaging is a PROHIBITED provider here
    wecare-elevenlabs-webhook    deleted with the TTS retirement

Why bother, given none of them is reachable
-------------------------------------------
An integration with no route cannot be invoked, so this is not an exposure. Three reasons
it is still worth removing:

1. **It misleads the next audit.** A grep for "sinch" across live AWS state returns these,
   and a reviewer then has to re-derive that they are unreachable. Retired-provider
   residue that keeps re-appearing in inventories is how a retirement gets re-litigated.
2. **`deploy_seo_tools.py` reuses an integration by matching the function name inside
   `IntegrationUri` and takes the FIRST match.** Several of these orphans target live
   functions, so duplicates are exactly the input that makes "find the existing
   integration" ambiguous.
3. The stale `RouteSettings` for two deleted routes blocked every per-route throttle write
   on this API until they were removed. Dead configuration is not always inert.

Safety
------
`--apply` deletes only integrations that, RE-CHECKED at delete time, have zero routes
pointing at them. The route list is re-read immediately before each delete rather than
trusted from the report, because this repo runs parallel sessions and a route created
between the two would otherwise be orphaned by this script.

Every integration is exported to `docs/execution/snapshots/` first, in full, so any
deletion can be reconstructed with `create_integration`. The four
prohibited-provider ones are additionally appended to
`docs/prohibited-provider-retirement.md`, which is where the standing authorization
requires retired-provider surfaces to be recorded before removal.

    python scripts/retire_orphan_integrations.py            # report + export, no deletes
    python scripts/retire_orphan_integrations.py --apply
    python scripts/retire_orphan_integrations.py --verify
