"""Per-function Lambda error alarms, for the functions that carry real traffic.

The gap this closes
-------------------
Measured 2026-09-28: the account had 41 alarms, none in `ALARM`, none in
`INSUFFICIENT_DATA`, every one with an action - and **56 of 66 Lambda functions had no
alarm at all**. The 41 covered 10 functions plus the DynamoDB tables, the API stage, the
DLQs and a cert.

The uncovered set was not the idle tail. It included:

    wecare-seo-tools              392,447 invocations in 7 days, the hottest in the fleet
    wecare-site-language           54,110  second hottest, on every public pageview
    wecare-messages-read            1,790
    wecare-contacts                 1,785
    wecare-rcs-dlr                  1,253
    wecare-whatsapp-calling         1,121
    wecare-customer-whatsapp-auth      58  and ACTUALLY FAILING - 1 error in 58, an
                                           "internal WhatsApp sender returned HTTP 400"
                                           on the customer OTP path

So the one function known to be failing a customer-facing flow was the one nobody would
be told about. `wecare-lambda-throttles` already provides an account-wide throttle net,
but there was no equivalent for errors: a function could fail every invocation and the
review would still come back green.

Why discovered rather than a hardcoded list
-------------------------------------------
A checked-in list of "important functions" is wrong the week after it is written - the
fleet went 58 -> 65 -> 66 in a month. This reads CloudWatch for 7-day invocation counts
and alarms anything above a floor, so a function that becomes busy acquires an alarm the
next time this runs, without anyone remembering to add it.

`ALWAYS` is the exception list, and it exists because volume is the wrong test for some
things. `wecare-customer-whatsapp-auth` runs 58 times a week; every one of those is
somebody trying to sign in. A money or identity path deserves an alarm at any volume.

Cost, stated because it is a real trade
---------------------------------------
CloudWatch charges about $0.10 per alarm per month. Covering all 66 functions with
errors-plus-duration would be ~130 alarms, ~$13/month, most of it watching functions that
run twice a week. The floor plus `ALWAYS` lands around 25 new alarms, ~$2.50/month, and
the account-wide net below catches anything the floor excludes. WAF was removed as an
$18/month cost decision, so spending is not free here and the number matters.

What it creates
---------------
    wecare-lambda-errors-<fn>      per function: Errors Sum > 0 over 5 min
    wecare-lambda-duration-<fn>    only where a function runs close to its timeout
    wecare-lambda-errors-any       ONE account-wide net, no FunctionName dimension

The account-wide net is the important cheap one: it cannot tell you WHICH function broke,
but it means a function below the floor cannot fail silently forever. It complements the
existing `wecare-lambda-throttles`, which is the same idea for throttling.

    python scripts/provision_lambda_alarms.py            # report only, no writes
    python scripts/provision_lambda_alarms.py --apply
    python scripts/provision_lambda_alarms.py --verify

Exit codes: 0 coverage is complete, 1 drift remains.
