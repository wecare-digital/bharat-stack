"""Ask each provider whether the credential in Secrets Manager actually works.

Rotating a key by hand has two failure modes that look identical from the outside:
the new value was typed wrong, or the new value was never activated at the
provider. Both leave Secrets Manager looking perfectly healthy. The only way to
tell is to spend the credential against the provider and read the answer.

Run this after every manual rotation. VALID means the provider accepted it just
now, not that a field is non-empty.

Statuses:
