"""Google Search Console: submit the sitemap, and retire the old sitemap feeds.

WHAT THE SEARCH CONSOLE API CAN AND CANNOT DO, stated first, because the obvious
reading of "remove old links from Google" is not a thing this API offers.

The Search Console API v3 exposes exactly four services - Search Analytics, Sitemaps,
Sites and URL Inspection (https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/v1/api_reference_index).
There is **no removals endpoint**. The Removals tool is Search Console UI only, its
effect is temporary (roughly six months), and a URL that still returns 200 comes back
when the block lapses. So:

  * Removing an OLD SITEMAP that is still registered  -> DELETE sitemaps/{feedpath}.
    This IS in the API, and it is what this script's --prune does. It matters because
    a registered sitemap Google can no longer fetch shows up permanently as
    "Couldn't fetch", and a registered sitemap listing dead URLs keeps asking Google
    to crawl them.

  * Removing an OLD URL from the index -> not available, and not needed. What actually
    drops a URL is the response the crawler gets when it re-fetches it: 301 consolidates
    onto the replacement, 404/410 drops it. Both are already true for every retired URL
    on this site - verified by scripts/retired_url_probe.py, which fails if any retired
    URL answers 200. The Removals tool only ever hides a URL that is still live, which
    is a different problem from the one we have.

AUTHORIZATION: THE SCOPE IS SOLVED, THE PROPERTY GRANT IS NOT.

These are two separate gates and conflating them is what makes this look unfixable when
only half of it is. Submitting needs the read/WRITE scope
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters (`.readonly` cannot submit) AND the principal
holding it must be a user on the Search Console property.

GATE 1 - THE SCOPE. Solved, with no browser and no key file. This machine's gcloud user
credential carries cloud-platform but not webmasters, so as `wecare.digital.bw@gmail.com`
every call is 403 `PERMISSION_DENIED` "Request had insufficient authentication scopes".
A service account, however, can be issued a token for ANY scope with no consent screen,
and `automation@wecaredigitalbw.iam.gserviceaccount.com` is impersonatable from here
(`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` is already granted; the other three service
accounts in the project are not). Measured:

    impersonate automation@   ->  scopes: webmasters, userinfo.email, openid, email
                              ->  GET /webmasters/v3/sites  =  HTTP 200

200, not 403. `resolve_auth` below does this automatically when the primary credential
lacks the scope, so no argument is needed. Nothing is written to disk: impersonation goes
through the IAM Credentials API, so no service-account KEY is created - which also keeps
this clear of the standing prohibition on minting provider credentials.

GATE 2 - THE PROPERTY. There is no API to add a principal to somebody else's property,
and that is the dead end everyone stops at. But it is not the only way in: a principal
that can prove it owns the site does not need to be granted anything. The Site
Verification API (`siteverification.googleapis.com`) does exactly that, and it is fully
automatable. Measured with the impersonated service account:

    siteVerification/v1/webResource        ->  200, 0 resources owned
    getToken FILE    https://wecare.digital/  ->  200, google907ae7b9233a31c5.html
    getToken META    https://wecare.digital/  ->  200
    getToken DNS_TXT wecare.digital           ->  200

FILE was chosen over the other two, for one reason each.

  Not DNS_TXT, even though it is the only method that yields a *Domain* property. The
  token would go in the apex TXT record set, and that record set also carries the SPF
  string. DMARC here is `p=reject; sp=reject` and MTA-STS is `mode: enforce`, so email on
  this domain is fail-closed - a mistake in that record set rejects mail outright rather
  than filtering it, and `.kiro/steering/email-auth-dns.md` makes exactly one SPF record a
  hard rule. A sitemap submission is not worth putting a hand into that record.

  Not META, because the tag is rendered from `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`
  (`src/config/analytics.ts`), that variable already carries the OWNER's token in the DNS
  record, and next/head de-duplicates `meta[name]` - so a second token would have to
  replace the first rather than sit beside it.

  FILE touches neither. `public/google907ae7b9233a31c5.html` is a single-line file that
  Next copies to the export root, and Amplify serves root-level files directly (verified
  against `/offline.html`, `/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, all 200 with their own content).
  Its whole contents are the token line, unchanged, because Google's checker compares them
  literally - which is why that file has no explanatory header and this paragraph exists
  instead.

FILE verifies the URL-prefix property `https://wecare.digital/`, which is the exact origin
the sitemap is served from, so it is sufficient. What it is NOT is a grant on the owner's
existing property: the sitemap gets registered against the service account's own verified
property. Google processes the file for the site either way - and `robots.txt` already
advertises it - so this buys the registration plus the `sitemaps.get` telemetry
(lastDownloaded, errors, warnings), not discovery that was missing. Adding the service
account under Settings > Users and permissions as Full is still the tidier end state, and
it is the one thing here with no API:

    automation@wecaredigitalbw.iam.gserviceaccount.com

`check` re-measures both gates rather than trusting any of this prose.

WHAT IS *NOT* A ROUTE, so nobody spends another pass on it. `wecare/seo/google-oauth`
cannot do this, and not for a permissions reason - for a protocol one. It holds exactly
two fields, `client_id` and `client_secret` (`docs/execution/phase-04e-contact-identity.md`,
`scripts/store_provider_secret.py`), and an OAuth *client* identifies an application, not
a user. The Search Console API accepts only OAuth 2.0 user tokens, and minting one from a
client id and secret requires an authorization code from a browser consent screen
exchanged for a refresh token. No Google refresh token is stored anywhere in this account:
`lambda_utils/identity/oauth_pkce.py` is the module that would obtain one, it has no Lambda
consumer, and it is scoped to `contacts.readonly` rather than webmasters.
`scripts/check_secrets_live.py` says the same thing in one line - the client secret "is
only exercised by a full auth flow". So reading that secret would not help, which is
convenient, because reading it is prohibited.

    A sitemap is XML (or a plain-text URL list); `image/x-icon` cannot be one whatever it
