/**
 * Write out/llms.txt and out/llms-full.txt — the curated map of this site for LLMs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT HONESTLY IS NOT
 * -----------------------------------------
 * llms.txt is a community convention (llmstxt.org, proposed by Jeremy Howard in September
 * 2024): a markdown file at the site root giving a model a pre-digested map of the
 * important pages instead of making it guess from HTML. Anthropic, Stripe, Vercel,
 * Cloudflare and Supabase publish one.
 *
 * It is worth having and it is not worth overselling. As of 2026 adoption sits somewhere
 * near one site in ten, Google has said Search does not use it, and no major AI vendor has
 * committed its answer engine to reading it. It is also NOT an access-control file: it
 * grants nothing, blocks nothing, and no crawler is obliged to look at it. robots.txt is
 * where permission lives.
 *
 * So the value here is cheap insurance plus one thing that is certain: it is a correct,
 * machine-readable statement of what this site publishes and how it may be cited, which is
 * useful to a human reviewer and to any agent pointed at it explicitly - including our own
 * MCP server at /mcp, which is the surface that actually has clients rather than hoping for
 * them. Treat /mcp as the load-bearing one and this as the fallback.
 *
 * WHY IT IS GENERATED RATHER THAN COMMITTED
 * -----------------------------------------
 * seo/llm/llms-txt-draft.md is the cautionary tale: a complete, careful, hand-written
 * llms.txt that advertises /bnb, /legal-champ, /ritual, [retired public path] and /_functions/* - the old
 * Wix site. Not one of those paths exists now. A hand-maintained file describing a site
 * that changes is a file that will be wrong, and wrong quietly.
 *
 * config/public-pages.json is the single source, shared with the MCP server's zip, and
 * src/test/PublicAiSurface.test.ts fails the build when it drifts from the two allowlists
 * that decide what is actually public.
 *
 * Its `pages` array is itself generated, by scripts/generate-public-pages.js, which runs
 * FIRST in the build chain. So the path from "a page was added" to "llms.txt and /mcp know
 * about it" needs no hand edit at all: the scan picks the route up, this file publishes it.
 *
 * RUN ORDER MATTERS: after generate-blog-search-index.js
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The 889 posts are not in this repository. They come from /api/seo-tools/blog-public,
 * which returns the whole corpus as 924 kB in about five seconds, and which is already the
 * hottest function in the fleet at ~392k invocations a week. generate-blog-search-index.js
 * has already fetched and trimmed exactly the fields needed and written them to
 * out/blog/search-index.json, so this reads that file instead of fetching a fourth copy
 * during one build. lib/public-blog.ts memoises for the same reason.
 *
 * FAILURE POLICY, which differs per artifact on purpose
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 *   REFUSE to write   a page listed here that is absent from the export, or any URL that
 *                     robots.txt disallows. Both would publish a statement we know to be
 *                     false: the first advertises a dead link, the second tells a crawler
 *                     to read a page it is forbidden to fetch.
 *   WARN only         a missing or empty blog index. This file degrades to the page map,
 *                     which is still correct. generate-sitemap.js takes the opposite line
 *                     and refuses, because a sitemap that silently loses 834 URLs is a
 *                     ranking event that takes weeks to undo; an llms.txt without the blog
 *                     section is a smaller, reversible loss.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/generate-llms-txt.js   (after next build, sitemap and search index)
