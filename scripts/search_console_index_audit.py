WHY A BATCH TOOL AND NOT `search_console_sitemap.py inspect`
-----------------------------------------------------------
That command inspects one URL. One URL cannot distinguish the two situations this
site might be in, and they call for completely different responses:

    a FEW urls unindexed    -> per-page problem: thin content, a bad canonical, a
                               soft 404
    ALL urls unindexed      -> site-level problem: host consolidation, crawl
                               budget, or simply never crawled

The sitemap reports `indexed=1` of `1353`, which points hard at the second, and the
only way to tell is to sample across page TYPES - home, marketing routes, the blog
index, a paginated blog page, and individual posts - then compare verdicts. A
sample of one from the wrong type produces a confident wrong answer.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, said up front
--------------------------------
There is no "request indexing" endpoint. URL Inspection is strictly diagnostic: it
reports what Google already knows and triggers nothing. The Indexing API exists but
is documented for JobPosting and BroadcastEvent only, so it does not apply to
ordinary pages. The Search Console UI's "Request indexing" button has no API
equivalent.

So this script tells you WHY and never pretends to fix it. That distinction matters
because the instinct on seeing `indexed=1` is to hunt for a button, and the useful
work is all upstream of any button.

READING `Discovered - currently not indexed` CORRECTLY. It does not mean rejected.
It means Google knows the URL exists and has not spent crawl budget on it. On a site
whose sitemap went un-fetched for four months and whose host canonical is still
being consolidated, that is the expected state rather than a fault, and the remedy
is consistent signals plus time. `Crawled - currently not indexed` would be a
different and worse answer, because it means Google fetched the page and declined
it - that one points at the page, not at crawl budget.

QUOTA. URL Inspection allows 2000 queries/day and 600/minute per property, so the
default sample of 10 sits far below both. `--count` raises it.

Auth is reused from search_console_sitemap.py: an impersonated service-account
token, no browser, no key file, no secret read or printed.
