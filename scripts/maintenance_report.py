PLIVO_ARCHITECTURE_NOTE = """\
Why no Plivo credential needs to move into a Lambda
---------------------------------------------------
The Plivo integration is INBOUND ONLY. Plivo authenticates TO us; we never
authenticate to Plivo at runtime.

    Meta WhatsApp Calling -> SIP -> Plivo Voice Application
      -> POST https://api.wecare.digital/plivo/answer   (wecare-plivo-answer)
      -> returns static XML: <Play> S3 audio + <Hangup/>
      -> on CallStatus=completed, invokes wecare-sms-aws:live for the follow-up SMS

wecare-plivo-answer makes NO Plivo API call. Its only secret is the optional
inbound shared token PLIVO_ANSWER_TOKEN, used to reject unsigned requests - a
different value that did not leak.

So there is nothing to migrate. The leaked auth id/token were used for one-time
PROVISIONING from a console/CLI (creating the Voice Application, pointing
answer_url, configuring the number), not as a runtime dependency.

How development works without them:
  * Local: POST a form-encoded payload at the handler. tests/test_plivo_answer.py
    already does exactly this, with no credential.
  * Production: Plivo calls us. Nothing to authenticate.

A Plivo credential would only be needed to ADD outbound capability - originating
calls, pulling CDRs, or buying numbers programmatically. If that is ever wanted,
create wecare/plivo-api and read it inside the Lambda by name. Do not pass it on
a command line (see .kiro/steering/secret-handling.md).
