"""Create the API routes three live dashboard pages already call and never reach.

What was wrong
--------------
Measured against `GetRoutes` on the only HTTP API (`zllr9lrg7j`), not inferred:

| Page | Calls | Route |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspace/docs` | `GET /docs/sources`, `POST /docs/sources`, `POST /docs/scrape`, `GET /docs/changelog` | **absent** |
| `/workspace/push` | `GET /push/devices`, `POST /push/send` | **absent** |
| `src/api/client.ts` | `GET` + `PUT /whatsapp-voice/language-config` | **absent** |

Every one of those calls 404s today, and **both pages hide it**. `/workspace/docs` wraps its
reads in `.catch(() => [])`, so it renders an empty source list and an empty changelog
as though that were the truth. `/workspace/push` checks `res.ok` and silently shows nothing.
So three screens look functional and cannot work - the same shape as the agent panel
advertising 18 refused tools and the `createInvoice` that returned success and wrote
no row.

The handlers were written expecting these routes
------------------------------------------------
This is not a feature being added. `docs-scraper` carries an explicit `ROUTE_ACTIONS`
map keyed on the exact strings `GET /docs/sources`, `POST /docs/sources`,
`POST /docs/scrape` and `GET /docs/changelog`. `push-notifications` dispatches on the
`devices` and `send` path segments and requires `Admin` for both.
`whatsapp-voice` handles `language-config` for GET and PUT and documents it in its own
docstring. All three are ready; only the wiring was missing.

`scripts/register_task12_routes.py` claims to register most of these. They are not in
the account, so either it never ran against this API or the routes were lost with the
second HTTP API that no longer exists. Either way the fix is to converge the account,
idempotently, and that is what this does.

Qualified where safe, unqualified where an alias would break the deploy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- `wecare-whatsapp-voice` already has a `live` alias, so its two routes reuse the
  existing `:live` integration.
- `wecare-push-notifications` is in `deploy_all_lambdas.py`, which calls
  `snapstart_publish.py`, which finds its targets by looking for a `live` alias. So
  creating one here immediately makes its deploys publish-and-move, and its routes get
  `:live`.
- `wecare-docs-scraper` gets an **unqualified** integration, deliberately. It is
  `PackageType=Image` and ships via `.github/workflows/docs-scraper-deploy.yml`, which
  runs `update-function-code` and nothing else. Give it an alias and every future
  deploy would report success and never reach production - the "it looked shipped"
  failure. The alias comes after the workflow learns to move one.

No OPTIONS routes are created: the API carries an API-level `CorsConfiguration`, so
preflight is answered by API Gateway before any route lookup.

Usage:
    python scripts/provision_missing_ui_routes.py            # report
    python scripts/provision_missing_ui_routes.py --apply
    python scripts/provision_missing_ui_routes.py --verify
