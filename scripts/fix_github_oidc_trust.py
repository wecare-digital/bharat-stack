"""Repair the GitHub Actions OIDC trust policies broken by the repository rename.

WHY. The GitHub repo was renamed `bharat-stack` -> `wecare-digital` on 2026-09-27.
Both deploy workflows authenticate by OIDC and then failed with

    Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

which reads as a credentials problem and is not one. This repository was created
2026-08-22, i.e. after 2026-07-15, so it uses GitHub's **immutable** subject
format:

    repo:OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID:ref:refs/heads/BRANCH

The owner id and repo id survive a rename -- that is the point of the format --
but the *name* segments do not, and they are still present in `sub`. So the
trust policies, which pinned the whole string with `StringEquals`, went stale at
the name and nowhere else:

    before  repo:wecare-digital@319896805/bharat-stack@1342943014:ref:refs/heads/stack
    after   repo:wecare-digital@319896805/wecare-digital@1342943014:ref:refs/heads/stack

Evidence this is the cause and not a coincidence: `seo-tools-deploy` succeeded at
2026-09-27T03:58Z and failed at 06:46Z with no change to the role, the workflow
or its permissions in between. The rename happened in that window.

WHAT THIS WRITES, and why it is not simply the corrected literal. Pinning the new
name would break again on the next rename. Instead the name segments become
wildcards while the two immutable ids are pinned twice over -- inside `sub` and
again as their own condition keys:

    StringEquals  aud                  = sts.amazonaws.com
    StringEquals  repository_owner_id  = 319896805
    StringEquals  repository_id        = 1342943014
    StringLike    sub                  = repo:*@319896805/*@1342943014:ref:refs/heads/stack

The effective grant is unchanged: branch `stack` of repository 1342943014 owned
by 319896805, and nothing else. It is strictly tighter than the previous policy,
because ids cannot be recycled by a namespace grab whereas names can, and AWS
still sees a `sub` condition that is not solely a wildcard (IAM rejects the
policy outright if it is).

DO NOT "FIX" THE ANALYZER WARNING. `aws accessanalyzer validate-policy` reports
WILDCARD_USAGE_TOO_PERMISSIVE against this document, advising at least six literal
characters before the `*` in `sub`. There are five (`repo:`), and the only way to add more
is to start spelling out the repository OWNER NAME -- which is the exact thing that went
stale on 2026-09-27 and took two deploy roles down for 22 hours. The warning is a generic
heuristic that cannot see the two `StringEquals` id conditions sitting beside the pattern;
with `repository_id` and `repository_owner_id` both pinned, the wildcard can only ever
match names that belong to those immutable ids. Leave it, and leave this paragraph here so
the next person reading an analyzer report does not undo it. (The MISSING_RESOURCE error in
the same report is the analyzer applying resource-policy rules to a trust policy; trust
policies have no `Resource` element.)

    python scripts/fix_github_oidc_trust.py --status
    python scripts/fix_github_oidc_trust.py --apply

`--status` also audits the account for `GitHubActions-*` roles this script does NOT
manage and exits non-zero if it finds any. That check exists because ROLES is a literal:
plivo-drift was created in AWS on 2026-09-28 and sat unregistered for a day while a test
asserted the list was complete. A list that cannot notice a role someone else created is
a list that certifies its own blind spot.

`--apply` snapshots each existing trust policy to
docs/execution/snapshots/ before writing, and is idempotent: a role already
holding the target document is reported UNCHANGED and skipped.

#
# The third was created fresh on 2026-09-28 02:55 with the *correct* new repo name,
# so it was never broken - but it pinned that name with StringEquals, which is the
# same latent bug one rename away from repeating this outage. It is included so all
# three are rename-proof and auditable from one command.
#
# The fourth is the write role for public-surface-deploy.yml, added 2026-09-28 at the
# same time as that workflow. It is listed here BEFORE it exists in AWS, deliberately:
# --status reports an absent role as such and --apply skips it, whereas a role created
# later and never added here is one that silently keeps whatever trust document the
# person who created it happened to paste. That is the exact latent trap
# test_fixer_covers_every_oidc_role holds down, and a role with WRITE permissions is
# the worst one to leave out of it.
#
# The fifth is the READ-ONLY half of the same workflow, and the split is the point: the write
# role is assumed only for the two steps that write, and the confirmation afterwards runs on a
# credential that cannot. Both share this trust document - the distinction between them is
# entirely in their permission policies, not in who may assume them.
#
# The sixth, plivo-drift, is the trap actually springing rather than a hypothetical.
# `scripts/provision_ci_plivo_drift_role.py` created it in AWS on 2026-09-28 07:21 and
# nobody added it here, so for a day this list -- and the test asserting the list was
# complete -- certified a set that was missing a live role. Added 2026-09-29 after
# `aws iam list-roles` was compared against it. That comparison is no longer manual:
# `unregistered()` below does it on every --status run, because a hand-maintained
# literal cannot notice a role someone else creates, and the two roles above show how
# ordinary it is for this list to be edited by somebody who is thinking about something
# else.
