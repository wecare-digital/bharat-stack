/**
 * Writes out/blog/search-index.json — the full post list, for search only.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * /blog/ used to hold all 834 posts in one document, and that is what let search and the
 * category pills filter the whole corpus: everything was already there. Pagination removed
 * that, for reasons in components/BlogIndexView.tsx - 842 kB of props and 115.5 screens of
 * DOM. Narrowing search to the visible 24 posts would have been a silent downgrade, so the
 * full list still ships; it just is not in the page any more.
 *
 * The browser fetches this ONCE, LAZILY, on the first keystroke or the first category press.
 * A reader who does not search never requests it.
 *
 * FOUR FIELDS, AND WHY EACH ONE
 * -----------------------------
 *   slug      the link target, and the React key
 *   title     matched, and rendered on the result card
 *   excerpt   matched, and rendered. The largest field at ~180 kB of the ~264 kB total, and
 *             it stays: dropping it would shrink this file to 84 kB and turn "search the
 *             blog" into "search blog titles", which is a different feature.
 *   category  matched, and rendered as the pill
 *
 * publishedDate and authorName are deliberately ABSENT even though the card renders both.
 * They are 41 kB, they are never matched, and a search result missing its byline is a much
 * smaller loss than 41 kB on every searching reader. The card already treats both as
 * optional because a post can legitimately lack them.
 *
 * WHY POST-BUILD AND NOT public/
 * ------------------------------
 * The content is not in this repository - it comes from wecare.digital/api/seo-tools/
 * blog-public at build time - so a file committed under public/ would be a snapshot that goes
 * stale the moment anything is published. Generated after `next build`, beside
 * generate-sitemap.js, which already works this way for the same reason.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT FAIL THE BUILD ON AN EMPTY LIST, and that is the opposite of the sitemap's
 * rule. generate-sitemap.js REFUSES to write a sitemap with zero posts, because a sitemap
 * that silently loses 834 URLs is an SEO event that takes weeks to undo. This file is a
 * progressive enhancement: if it is missing or empty, BlogIndexView says so in a notice and
 * searches the current page instead. Blocking a deploy over a degraded search box would be
 * the more expensive failure.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/generate-blog-search-index.js   (after next build)

/**
 * ?fields= ASKS FOR THE FOUR THIS FILE KEEPS, instead of downloading 924 kB to discard
 * half of it.
 *
 * The header above already explains that publishedDate and authorName are deliberately
 * absent from the output because they cost 41 kB and are never matched. That reasoning
 * applies with more force to the transfer itself: the unprojected response carries
 * jsonLd, keywords, hashtags, robots, focusKeyword and metaDescription for all 889 posts,
 * none of which appear in the index this writes.
 *
 * Kept as a named constant beside the endpoint so the two cannot drift: if a field is
 * added to the card shape below, it has to be added here or it arrives undefined.
