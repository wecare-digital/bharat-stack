"""Emit the integration registry as JSON the frontend can render.

Why a generated snapshot rather than a live API call
---------------------------------------------------
`lambda_utils/integrations/registry.py` was built in 7.1 and then imported by
**nothing** — it described eight providers and no surface showed them. This closes that
without inventing an endpoint, because the registry makes **no provider call**: it is a
static description plus a `DescribeSecret` existence check. There is no live number to
fetch, so an HTTP round trip would add a route, an auth gate and a failure mode in order
to return a constant.

What that costs, stated rather than skipped: the credential-existence half is frozen at
generation time. The registry's own doctrine is that *freshness must be explicit and
comparable* — "a cached metric rendered without its age is how a dashboard shows last
week's numbers as today's" — so the snapshot carries `generatedAt` and the pages render
it. A stale snapshot is visible rather than silent.

Regenerate whenever a credential or scope changes:

    python scripts/generate_integration_inventory.py

`--check` exits 1 if the committed file is out of date, so CI can catch a registry change
that never reached the UI.
