"""Verify Secrets Manager entries contain the expected FIELDS, without exposing values.

Reports, per secret: the JSON key names, each value's length and an irreversible
`sha256[:12]` fingerprint. That is enough to confirm a field is populated and to
tell across runs whether it is still the same value, while never putting the
value into agent context, a log, a command line or a file.

**Corrected 2026-09-29.** This docstring used to describe the fingerprint as
"first 4 / last 2 characters", and `fingerprint()` did exactly that - so the
report disclosed six characters of every field of all seven secrets. See that
function for why a prefix and a length are not a safe rendering.

Exit 0 always; this is a report.
