"""Find every URL Google still has impressions for that this site no longer serves.

WHY THIS IS NOT scripts/retired_url_probe.py. That script probes a HAND-WRITTEN list
assembled from this repository's own record of removals, and it answers one question:
"did we leave a retired page serving 200?" It is a regression guard, and it can only
ever know about removals somebody wrote down.

This script asks the opposite question, and takes its list from Google rather than from
us: "which URLs is Google still SHOWING, that we answer with a 404?" Those are the ones
losing accumulated ranking, and the repo has no record of most of them because they were
Wix-era pages that never existed in this codebase at all.

The distinction is load-bearing. A 404 is the correct answer for a page that was deleted
because it was wrong. It is the WRONG answer for a page that was replaced, because a 404
discards the link equity instead of passing it to the replacement - and equity is the one
thing a new export cannot regenerate on its own.

THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS IS THE www ONE. There are two Search Console properties:

    https://www.wecare.digital/    480 days of history   the Wix-era site
    https://wecare.digital/        created 2026-09-30    the current export, no backfill

Reading only the apex property shows zero impressions and invites the conclusion that the
site is invisible to Google. It is not - the history lives under www, which now 301s to
the apex. So this script queries BOTH and merges, keyed on path.

OUTPUT is a verdict per path:

    SERVED        answers 200 - nothing to do
    REDIRECTED    answers 301/308 - equity already consolidated
    RECOVERABLE   answers 404 AND has impressions - this is the actionable set
    GONE-QUIET    answers 404 with no impressions - correctly dead, leave it

Read-only. Touches no Amplify configuration; scripts/provision_legacy_redirects.py owns
that. No secret value is read or printed.
