"""Prove the apex short-link path resolves, and that the retired subdomain stays retired.

Why this is a live probe and not a unit test
--------------------------------------------
Short-link resolution is not a property of the handler. It is the product of three
independent pieces of live configuration, and the handler is only one of them:

  1. `GET /r/{code}` on HTTP API `zllr9lrg7j`
  2. the Amplify custom rule `/r/<*>` -> the API, which must sit BEFORE the
     `/<*>` -> `/index.html` SPA catch-all or it can never match
  3. the `live` alias of `stack-wecare-url-shortener` pointing at current code

A unit test can assert none of that. Any of the three can be removed by a console
click or a well-meaning cleanup, and they fail silently - the SPA catch-all in
particular answers `200` with the app shell, so a broken short link looks like a
working page rather than an error.

What changed on 2026-09-28, and why this script was inverted
-----------------------------------------------------------
There used to be a fourth piece: the `r.wecare.digital` API Gateway custom domain.
This script asserted that host still resolved, and said in as many words "do not
'fix' this by retiring the old host; it is the links already sent that cannot be
changed". That was the right call on the evidence available, and the owner
subsequently made the opposite one: the Route 53 record was deleted under
`YES R53-DELETE-001` (before-state in
`docs/execution/snapshots/route53-r-subdomain-before-delete-20260928.json`).

So the old assertion now fails on a deliberate decision rather than on a defect,
and a guard that fails for a reason nobody intends to act on stops being read.

The consequence is real and is NOT what this script is for: every short link already
delivered on `r.wecare.digital` - printed material, sent SMS, RCS cards already on
handsets - is dead, and no configuration change here can recall them. That is recorded
in `docs/media-bucket-merge.md` and the change-authority matrix. What this script now
does is narrower and still worth having:

  wecare.digital/r/<code>    MUST resolve - this is what we mint, and all we serve
  r.wecare.digital/<code>    MUST NOT resolve - retirement must stay complete

The second check is not spite. A retired host that quietly comes back - an IaC deploy
re-creating the alias record is the likely route, which is why those constructs were
deleted from `amplify/link-resources.ts` - would start serving links again from a
certificate and mapping nobody is maintaining. Either state is defensible; drifting
between them silently is not.

`operations/system-cleanup` still protects the link tables from factory reset, on the
same grounds as before: the codes themselves remain valid on the apex path.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/check_short_link_hosts.py
    python scripts/check_short_link_hosts.py --code wa

Exit 0 means the apex forms resolve and the retired host does not. Non-zero names
the mismatch.
