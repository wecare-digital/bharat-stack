"""Create the read-only OIDC role that `route-auth.yml`'s live-AWS job needs.

WHY IT WAS NEVER RUNNING. `.github/workflows/route-auth.yml` has two jobs. The
source-scanning half runs on every push and blocks. The `live-gate` half is guarded
by `if: vars.ROUTE_AUTH_ROLE_ARN != ''`, and that repository variable has never been
set -- `gh variable list` returns nothing -- so the job has silently reported
"skipped" since the day it was written. The guard is the right design (a fork must
not go red for a reason a contributor cannot fix), but it means the absence looks
identical to a pass in the checks list. Only the console-drift half can catch a
route added straight in the console, which is exactly the class of change the
source scan is blind to.

THE SUBJECT CLAIM CARRIES BOTH IDS AND NAMES, AND ONLY THE IDS SURVIVE A RENAME.
Corrected 2026-09-28 against measured evidence. This docstring previously claimed the
ID-qualified subject "survives a rename" and that the two older roles "kept working"
through it. **Both halves were wrong**, and the error was load-bearing, because it
justified pinning the whole subject string with `StringEquals`.

GitHub's immutable subject format is

    repo:OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID:ref:refs/heads/BRANCH

The ids survive a rename. The NAME segments are still in the string and do not. So
when the repo became `wecare-digital/wecare-digital` on 2026-09-27, the two older
roles -- `GitHubActions-bharat-stack-docs-scraper` and `-seo-tools` -- stopped
working immediately, exactly like the Amplify app did. They failed with

    Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

from 06:46 on 2026-09-27 until repaired on 2026-09-28. `seo-tools-deploy` succeeded
at 03:58Z and failed at 06:46Z that day with no change to the role, the workflow or
its permissions -- the rename is the only event in the window. So the Amplify app was
not the only name-pinned casualty; it was merely the loudest.

Consequence for this script: pinning the corrected NAME would be the same bug one
rename later, and re-running `--apply` with a name-pinned document would silently
revert the hardening applied by `scripts/fix_github_oidc_trust.py`. The trust
document below therefore wildcards the name segments and pins the ids twice -- inside
`sub` via `StringLike`, and again as their own `repository_id` /
`repository_owner_id` conditions. The effective grant is identical to the
name-pinned form and strictly tighter, because ids cannot be recycled by a namespace
grab whereas freed names can. IAM still sees a `sub` condition that is not solely a
wildcard, which it rejects outright.

Keep this file and `scripts/fix_github_oidc_trust.py` writing the SAME document, or
whichever runs last wins and the drift returns.

PERMISSIONS. Exactly the four calls `audit_route_auth.py` makes --
`apigatewayv2:GET` on the API collection plus `lambda:ListFunctions` -- and nothing
else. No `secretsmanager`, no write verb anywhere. `apigatewayv2:GET` is the one
coarse action the service offers for reads; it cannot mutate.
