"""Create the OIDC role that `plivo-drift.yml` needs, scoped to one secret.

WHY THIS WAS HELD BACK, AND WHAT CHANGED. `plivo-drift.yml` is guarded by
`if: vars.PLIVO_DRIFT_ROLE_ARN != ''` and that variable has never been set, so the drift
job has reported SKIPPED since it was written -- the same failure mode as
`route-auth.yml`'s live gate, where absence is indistinguishable from a pass in the
checks list.

Unlike route-auth, this job needs `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`. Granting GitHub
Actions the ability to read a live provider credential genuinely widens who can read it,
so it sat outside the standing grant and was reported as an owner decision rather than
done quietly. It is created here under explicit authorisation.

WHAT KEEPS IT NARROW. Three things, all asserted by `--verify`:

1. **One secret, by ARN.** `wecare/plivo/api` only -- the id
   `scripts/plivo_control_plane.py` actually reads. Not `wecare/plivo`, not
   `wecare/plivo-answer`, not a wildcard. A `Deny` on every other secret ARN backs the
   allow, so a future widening of the allow statement still fails.
2. **Read only.** `GetSecretValue`, `DescribeSecret`, and `kms:Decrypt` on the one key
   that secret is encrypted with. No `Put`, no `Update`, no `Delete`, no `List` -- the role
   cannot even discover what other secrets exist. The decrypt is conditioned on
   `kms:ViaService` so it cannot be used against KMS directly, and a second `Deny` holds it
   to that single key.
3. **Branch `stack` of this repository, by numeric ID.** `repo:*@319896805/*@1342943014:
   ref:refs/heads/stack` plus `repository_id` / `repository_owner_id` as their own
   condition keys. Names are excluded deliberately: the rename on 2026-09-27 broke every
   policy that pinned a name, and ids cannot be recycled by a namespace grab.

The drift job is read-only by construction -- it compares live Plivo configuration
against the committed expectation and reports -- so this grant cannot mutate either side.

THE KMS HOP, ADDED 2026-09-29. The role as first created on 2026-09-28 held both Secrets
Manager read verbs and still could not read the secret, because `wecare/plivo/api` is
encrypted with a customer-managed key and Secrets Manager performs that decrypt with the
CALLER's credentials. The job's first real run failed with `AccessDeniedException: Access
to KMS is not allowed` and -- because `plivo-reconcile` returned the same exit code for a
failed init as for CRITICAL drift -- reported it as live call routing having moved. Both
halves are fixed: `kms:Decrypt` is granted here, and the exit codes are now distinct.

#: The exact secret `scripts/plivo_control_plane.py` reads (`SECRET_ID`). The trailing

#: The customer-managed key that encrypts `wecare/plivo/api` -- `alias/wecare-secrets-manager`,

#: drift job failed on the first run where it was actually used (2026-09-28):
#:
#:     could not initialise Plivo control plane: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException)
#:     when calling the GetSecretValue operation: Access to KMS is not allowed
#:
#: `GetSecretValue` on a CMK-encrypted secret is TWO authorisations, not one. Secrets Manager
#: does not decrypt with its own privileges; it re-calls KMS with the CALLER's, so a role
#: holding every Secrets Manager read verb and no `kms:Decrypt` is denied at the second hop.
#: On a secret left under the AWS-managed `aws/secretsmanager` key the same policy works,
#: which is exactly why the gap is easy to write and invisible until the first real run.

#: the grant cannot be used to decrypt anything by calling KMS directly. It mirrors the
