"""Per-alert triage for `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`, with evidence.

WHY THIS IS NOT A BULK DISMISSAL. Rule 28 accepts an alert as closed when it is either
remediated or **formally triaged with evidence**, and 202 open alerts with 0 triaged is a
failing gate. But dismissing 202 alerts on one generic reason is the rubber stamp the
rule exists to prevent, and it is how the real findings in this pile stayed hidden: a
full phone number in ~30 logger dicts, a WhatsApp Flow token whose `-ph-` suffix is the
number, and a `contactId` that is literally `wa` + the customer's digits across 85 sites.
All of those were remediated first. This handles only what is left.

WHAT IT PROVES, PER ALERT. The alert location points at the whole `json.dumps({...})`
call rather than at the element CodeQL considers sensitive, and the REST API does not
expose the code flow. So instead of guessing which element was flagged, this enumerates
**every** key/value pair in the logged dict and classifies each one. If no element can
carry identifying data, the alert is safe no matter which element CodeQL picked -- a
stronger argument than matching its choice would have been.

An alert is only dismissed when every element classifies as safe. Anything holding one
UNPROVEN element stays open and is reported for a human to read, because "I could not
prove this" and "this is fine" must not produce the same outcome.

KNOWN BLIND SPOT, recorded 2026-09-29: THIS SCRIPT CANNOT SEE AN F-STRING.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything above reasons about `ast.Dict` elements, so an alert whose location is a plain
f-string log gets the reason `neither a logger dict nor a print() at location` and stays
open. Read that string as **"not classifiable by this tool"**, never as "safe" and never
as "not a log line" - 23 of the 52 currently open alerts land in that bucket, and they are
ordinary logger calls:

    logger.info(f"Post-call reaction: ... to={mask_phone(to_number or '')} ...")

`tests/test_log_phone_masking.py` had the identical gap for the identical reason and it was
hiding real disclosures - fourteen log lines printing whole E.164 numbers, which CodeQL
found only six of. That module now walks `ast.JoinedStr` as well, in `fstring_offences()`,
and its classifier (`_consuming_call` / `_is_logger` / `_is_sanitised`) is the thing to port
here rather than write again.

AND A SECOND, DEEPER POINT: masking does NOT clear these alerts, and should not be expected
to. `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` is a taint query. `mask_phone(to_number)` still
has `to_number` flowing into the sink, and CodeQL has no reason to believe `mask_phone`
sanitises anything - the same behaviour `.kiro/steering/secret-handling.md` documents for
the secret case ("reducing a secret to a boolean does not launder it"), and it is correct to
behave that way. Fixing the fourteen real sites moved the open count 58 -> 56, not to zero.

So the remaining count is not a backlog of defects and chasing it to zero by dismissal would
destroy the signal.

THE MODEL-PACK ROUTE DOES NOT EXIST FOR THIS QUERY. Measured 2026-09-29, correcting what
this docstring used to recommend first.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The previous text named "a model pack under `.github/codeql/` declaring `mask_phone` /
`mask_contact_id` / `mask_flow_token` as sanitisers" as *the only fix that makes the count
mean something again*, and asked the next reader to check whether Python data extensions
supported sanitisers yet. They do — CodeQL 2.25.2 added `barrierModel` and
`barrierGuardModel` to models-as-data for Python, and this repository analyses on 2.27.1.
The version was never the blocker. **The query is.**

`CleartextLoggingQuery.qll` declares its barrier as:

    predicate isBarrier(DataFlow::Node node) { node instanceof Sanitizer }

and `CleartextLogging::Sanitizer` is an `abstract class` with **no subclasses anywhere in
the CodeQL libraries** and no models-as-data hook. A `barrierModel` tuple only takes effect
in a query whose customizations consume `ModelOutput::barrierNode`, and for Python that is
exactly nine queries: CodeInjection, CommandInjection, **LogInjection**, PathInjection,
ReflectedXSS, ServerSideRequestForgery, SqlInjection, UnsafeDeserialization, UrlRedirect.
`py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` is not among them.

Note the near miss, because it is how this mistake gets made twice: `py/log-injection` IS
on that list, so a model pack declaring a sanitiser genuinely works for log *injection* and
the public write-ups that recommend one are not wrong — they are about the other rule. The
two rules look alike, sit in the same files, and behave completely differently here.

A QL-level customization extending `CleartextLogging::Sanitizer` would work, but it means
shipping and compiling a custom query pack pinned to a library version, which silently
breaks on CodeQL upgrades. Not worth it for this.

SO THERE IS ONE ROUTE, and it is the one this file is: extend the classifier until it can
read the remaining sites, THEN dismiss with per-element evidence. That is not a mass
dismissal, and a mass dismissal is not an acceptable substitute for it: it reduces security
visibility, and the 39 real findings in this pile were only found because nobody had done
that.

#

# only, and none of those names carries a hint, so it correctly gives up. Resolving the
# name to what it is actually bound to is what turns "I cannot attribute this" into
# evidence, and it is the same discipline as the dict walk: read the code rather than
# pattern-match the identifier.
#
# EVERY RULE HERE FAILS CLOSED. A binding form that is not read returns UNPROVEN, and a
# name with several bindings must have all of them classify safe. The specific traps:
#
#   * A function PARAMETER is never resolvable -- its value comes from a caller this pass
#     cannot see. Treating a parameter as its default would be the classic wrong answer.
#   * `except ... as e` binds an exception OBJECT, whose str() is provider text that can
#     contain anything, including a recipient number. `.kiro/steering/secret-handling.md`
#     requires `type(exc).__name__` unless our own code built the message, so this must
#     stay UNPROVEN and be remediated rather than dismissed.
#   * A module constant counts only when the module binds it EXACTLY ONCE. A name assigned
#     twice at module scope can hold either value and neither binding proves the other.
#   * Recursion is bounded. `x = x + 1` and two names assigned from each other both
#     terminate on the depth limit rather than on the stack, which is the failure the
#     first version of `classify` had.
