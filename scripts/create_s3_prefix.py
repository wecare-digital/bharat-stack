"""Create a folder (prefix marker) in the EXISTING bucket. Never creates a bucket.

Read this before using it, because S3 folders are not what they look like
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
S3 has no directories. `o/stack/invoices/x.png` is one flat key; the "folders" the console
shows are inferred from the `/` characters in keys that exist. So writing an object to a new
prefix needs no folder, and a prefix with no objects does not appear at all.

Measured in `wecare-digital-get` on 2026-09-30: **zero** 0-byte folder markers exist. Every
prefix in the bucket - `o/stack/`, `secure/d/`, `secure/u/` and the rest - exists only because
a real object was written into it.

So a marker is only worth creating when the prefix must be visible or reserved *before* its
first object arrives. Two reasons that can be true here:

1. **It survives a cleanup wipe.** `operations/system-cleanup._wipe_s3_prefix` deletes content
   and explicitly skips keys ending in `/`, so a marked folder still exists after a purge while
   an unmarked one silently vanishes from the console.
2. **It documents intent.** `secure/stack/invoices/` is where `invoice-engine` and
   `inbound-whatsapp-handler` now write, and it held no objects, so nothing in the console
   showed that the gated invoice location had moved there.

The bucket is fixed and the guard is deliberate
----------------------------------------------
`.kiro/steering/blog-production-s3.md` requires the existing bucket `wecare-digital-get` and
forbids creating another without explicit approval; `.kiro/hooks/block-s3-bucket-creation.json`
refuses the command shapes that would. This script has no create-bucket path at all - it
verifies the bucket exists and refuses if it does not, rather than helpfully making one.

Keys are composed through `lambda_utils.media_paths`, which owns the `o/` (public, served by
CloudFront with no authentication) versus `secure/` (gated) distinction. A prefix passed here
must already be rooted; an unrooted one is refused rather than silently placed under `o/`,
because guessing the root is how something private ends up public.

Usage:
    python scripts/create_s3_prefix.py --list
    python scripts/create_s3_prefix.py secure/stack/invoices/ --dry-run
    python scripts/create_s3_prefix.py secure/stack/invoices/
