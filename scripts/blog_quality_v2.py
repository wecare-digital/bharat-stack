"""WECARE.DIGITAL Conversations Content Quality Standard v2, as executable checks.

WHAT THIS IS, AND THE ONE THING IT DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO DO.

The standard has 34 sections. Some are mechanically decidable - a slug either collides
or it does not, a meta description either fits its band or it does not, a body either
carries an image node or it does not. Those are implemented here, and they fail the
build.

Several are not decidable by a program, and pretending otherwise would be the single
most damaging thing this file could do. Section 29 asks for a PASS/FAIL on ORIGINAL
EXPRESSION ("independently Anew rather than cosmetically rewritten"), on VOICE, and on
SUBSTANCE; section 30 asks a reader whether the article "was written because there was
something worth saying". A regex cannot answer any of those, and a pipeline that
auto-stamps them would convert the standard into a rubber stamp while reporting
100% compliance.

So the rule this module enforces is:

    mechanical checks can only ever move a record DOWN, never up to READY_TO_PUBLISH.

`decide_status` will return EDITORIAL_QA for a record that passes every machine check
but carries no human verdict. READY_TO_PUBLISH requires a human to have recorded the
human-only gates in `record['gate']`. Section 32's "only READY_TO_PUBLISH may enter the
Wix publishing queue" is therefore preserved rather than defeated: the machine clears
the mechanical debt so the human time goes where only human judgement works.

Two categories are supported, because two exist on the live site: Conversations and
Gastronomy. Gastronomy additionally carries the recipe structure its own gate already
enforces, and those checks are reproduced here rather than imported so this module has
no boto3 dependency and runs anywhere.

Usage:
    python scripts/blog_quality_v2.py validate --manifest content/conversations/batches/CONV-001-CONV-025.json
    python scripts/blog_quality_v2.py report   --manifest <file> [--json]
