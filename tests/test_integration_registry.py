"""The shared integration registry: what we can read, from whom, and how stale it is.

Measured 2026-09-23 before writing any of it, because the item's provider list and
the repo's actual state disagree:

    provider            adapter files    credential
    Google Ads              0            wecare/google/ads
    Search Console          0            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Play Reporting          0            NONE
    GA4                     6            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Business Profile        4            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Bing Webmaster         14            wecare/bing/api
    Meta Ads / CTWA        26            wecare/meta-system-user-token
    Wix                    31            env fallback, no secret

So three of the eight have no adapter at all, and one of those has no credential
either. There was no registry of any kind.

The three decisions this module exists to enforce
-------------------------------------------------
**Access is three-state, never a boolean.** A credential existing is not the same as
a scope being granted, and that distinction has already cost this project once: the
Google OAuth client exists and works, but `contacts.readonly` was never added to the
consent screen, so the identity import is blocked on a provider setting rather than
on code. `CREDENTIAL_ABSENT` / `SCOPE_UNVERIFIED` / `VERIFIED` keeps that honest.

**A read carries its provider request id, or records that it has none.** Without one
there is no support conversation to be had with Google or Meta — "it returned the
wrong number yesterday" is unactionable. Absent is recordable; fabricated is not.

**Freshness is explicit and comparable.** A cached metric rendered without its age
is how a dashboard shows last week's numbers as today's. Every result carries
`fetched_at` and the provider's own `max_age_seconds`, and `stale` is derived rather
than asserted by the caller.

Read-only by construction: this module has no write verb. Not a flag, not a guard —
there is nothing here that could mutate a provider.
