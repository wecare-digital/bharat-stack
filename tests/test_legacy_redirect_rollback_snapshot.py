"""`--apply` must write the pre-change rules BEFORE it changes them, or there is no way back.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `provision_legacy_redirects.py --apply` rewrites the live Amplify
`customRules` array - 112 rules governing every retired URL on the public site. Until
2026-09-29 the only rollback artefact it produced was
`docs/execution/snapshots/amplify-custom-rules-before-8.4.json`, and that file is written
once and then kept forever, so it holds the THREE rules the app had on 2026-09-24. The
workflow summary named it as the thing to restore from. Restoring it would have deleted every
rule added since - the `/mcp` rewrite, the `/get/<*>` CDN passthrough, the whole `/workspace`
tree - a far larger outage than whatever it was reverting.

The timestamped snapshot that replaced it has two properties worth pinning, because both are
invisible on a successful run and only matter on the day someone needs them:

  1. it holds what was live, not what is about to be written;
  2. it is on disk BEFORE `update_app` is called.

Property 2 is the one a refactor breaks silently. A snapshot written after the write - or in
the same try block after an exception - is a file that describes the state you already lost.
The fake client here asserts the file exists at the moment `update_app` runs, so the ordering
is checked rather than assumed.

No AWS call is made: the client is a stub and `apply()` takes it as an argument.
