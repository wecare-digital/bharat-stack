"""Monotonic payment status, the shared vocabulary, and the webhook dedup key.

Two of the three defects tested here were measured on live traffic, not inferred.

Defect 1 - the dedup key dropped real events. CloudWatch, 4 days to 2026-09-23:

    events received                                       3030
    skipped as duplicates                                 1495
    dedup keys delivered more than once                    1347
      of those, keys whose deliveries carried DIFFERENT bodies 19
    distinct events silently dropped (lower bound)          59

Defect 2 - `_handle_downtime` read `event_data.get('downtime')` while the entity arrives
under the literal key `payment.downtime`. All 607 live downtime events were processed with
`method: ""` and `instrument: "{}"`, confirmed in CloudWatch. Downtime is the only payment
webhook traffic this account has ever received.

Defect 3 - payment status was an unconditional `put_item`, so a redelivered
`payment.captured` after `refund.processed` reset the status AND erased the refund fields,
because the record written carries no refund attributes and a put replaces the whole item.
Latent - PaymentsTable holds 0 rows - but it is the one that misstates money.
