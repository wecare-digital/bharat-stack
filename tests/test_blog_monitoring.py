"""Monitoring: the failure modes the existing Lambda-error alarm structurally cannot see.

WHY THESE ALARMS ARE NOT REDUNDANT.

`wecare-lambda-errors-wecare-seo-tools` already alarms on unhandled Lambda errors, and it is the
wrong instrument for this pipeline. Every failure mode here is CAUGHT and recorded on a record
rather than raised, which is correct: one bad PDF must not stop a batch of 2,500, a failed
verification is evidence rather than a crash, a rejected post is a defect rather than an outage.

The consequence is the thing worth testing. A run in which every single document failed produces
zero Lambda errors, so from the existing alarms it is indistinguishable from a run in which every
document succeeded.

THE TEST THAT CARRIES THIS FILE is `test_a_refusal_never_pages_anybody`. A refusal is an operator
having switched Wix writes off. Paging somebody because the switch they threw is working is how a
channel gets ignored, and an ignored channel is worth less than no channel.
