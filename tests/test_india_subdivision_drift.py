"""The state dropdown and the tax table must name the same 36 places.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
`src/config/indiaSubdivisions.ts` is a second copy of the keys of
`lambda_utils.ecommerce.wix_address.INDIA_SUBDIVISIONS`, and a copy of a table that decides
money is exactly the kind of duplicate that goes stale quietly. The subdivision is the place of
supply, so it decides the CGST/SGST versus IGST split.

Both directions are failures, and both are silent without this test:

* a name the form OFFERS that the Python table cannot resolve is a dead-end loop - the address
  saves, and then pay time refuses with ``UNMAPPABLE_STATE`` on a value the customer cannot
  correct, because nothing on screen says which spelling was wanted;
* a key the Python table HAS that the form does not offer is a customer who cannot enter their
  own state at all.

A set comparison catches both, which is why this asserts equality rather than a subset.

Case, aliases, and order
------------------------
The server lowercases before lookup (`india_subdivision` normalises whitespace, lowercases, and
maps ``&`` to ``and``), so the TS display names only have to match case-insensitively. Order is
deliberately not pinned: the TS file is alphabetical so the select is scannable, while the Python
table is in GST state-code order.

`INDIA_ALIASES` is NOT part of the comparison. It is a lookup convenience for spellings that turn
up in real data and Google Places output ("NCT of Delhi", "Orissa", "Daman and Diu"), so offering
one in the dropdown would mean offering a non-canonical name. The alias test is that the keys, and
only the keys, appear in the TS file.

Parsing
-------
Every single-quoted literal in the TS source, the same `re.findall` shape the repo's other
drift tests use against a TypeScript file. That is why `indiaSubdivisions.ts` carries a note
forbidding any other single-quoted string in it, comments included - a stray apostrophe in prose
would read as a 37th state.
