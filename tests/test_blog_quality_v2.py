GOOD_BODY = """A person gives their word and then does not honour it. The ordinary response reaches for morality: they were wrong, they should feel bad, they are not to be trusted. That reading arrives instantly and explains nothing about what actually broke.

Something was counting on the word. A schedule, a decision someone else made on the strength of it, a resource committed. The word was load-bearing. When it came out, the structure moved, and the movement is visible whether or not anybody feels guilty about it afterwards.

## What workability asks instead

Workability asks a different question from whether the person is good. It asks what became possible, and what stopped being possible. A colleague who reliably says what will happen creates a condition in which other people can plan against it. One whose word is decorative forces everybody around them to carry a private second plan, and that cost is paid quietly, in duplicated effort nobody ever logs.

Restoring a broken word is not apologising for it. An apology addresses the feeling. Restoration addresses the structure: saying plainly what was not done, acknowledging what it cost the people who were relying on it, and saying what will happen now instead. Notice how rarely that third part appears anywhere.

What appears instead is explanation, aimed at the listener's judgement rather than at the thing that broke. Explanation asks to be excused. Restoration asks what is needed. The difference is not one of tone, and a listener can usually tell which is happening within a sentence or two of the attempt beginning."""
