"""The public-surface role's policy must be the calls the scripts make. No more, no less.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/iam-public-surface-README.md` claims every action in
`iam-public-surface-permissions.json` is a call one of the two deploy scripts actually
makes. That claim was written by reading the source, and reading the source is exactly the
step that does not survive the next edit. When it was checked mechanically, on 2026-09-29,
it was wrong in both directions at once:

  * MISSING `apigateway:DELETE`. `deploy_mcp_server.py` calls `delete_route_settings` to
    drop throttle entries left behind by deleted routes - it has to, because UpdateStage
    validates the merged map and a stale key makes it unwritable. Without the grant, an
    `apply` run fails with AccessDenied AFTER `provision_legacy_redirects.py` has already
    rewritten the live Amplify rules. A half-applied deploy is the worst outcome available
    to this workflow, and it was one retired route away.
  * GRANTED BUT NEVER CALLED: `lambda:GetPolicy` and `lambda:GetAlias`. The README
    explained GetPolicy as what makes re-running idempotent. It is not: `add_permission`
    is wrapped in `except ResourceConflictException`. The grant was unused and the
    documented reason for it was fiction.

Neither is catastrophic on its own. Together they are the reason a hand-checked permission
list is not evidence. This test derives the list from the boto3 calls in the two scripts,
so adding a call fails until the policy and the README catch up, and removing one fails
until the grant goes.

No AWS call is made and no credential is read.
