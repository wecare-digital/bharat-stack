"""Plivo CDR rows must be readable by the CDR dashboard, not just present.

Regression guard for a silent failure. `plivo-answer._persist_cdr` had been
writing rows into VoiceCDRTable since the Plivo migration, in snake_case only.
Every read path (voice-cdr-read._format_record_for_ui, _calculate_stats, and the
CDR tab) binds to camelCase Airtel-era names, so those rows were in the table and
invisible in the product:

  * blank caller / destination / status cells
  * no date at all - there was no `createdAt`, which is BOTH the sort key for the
    read paths and the fallback the date renderer uses when `timestamp` is absent,
    so every Plivo row sorted to 0 and fell off the bottom of a limited page
  * they inflated `stats.total` while counting as neither inbound nor outbound
    and neither answered nor missed

Nothing raised. The tests below assert the reader-facing contract rather than the
storage call, because "put_item was called" was already true while the feature
was broken.

# unreachable so that Plivo REDELIVERS, and a redelivery can land after hangup.
#
# The consequence is not a cosmetic field: a mid-call payload carries no
# Duration, `_plivo_overall_status` downgrades a zero-duration `completed` to
# 'Missed', and `_calculate_stats` counts answered/missed off exactly that field.
# An answered call would be reported as missed.
