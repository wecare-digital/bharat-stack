"""Two-leg settlement: a verified Razorpay capture is necessary and NOT sufficient.

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/gift-cards-service-plugin-20261001.md`
sections 3.1 (the ladder), 3.2 (`is_fully_settled`), 3.3 (ordering) and 7.3 (the closed evidence
set), and the test list in section 9.1 (tests 65-86, including 83a, 83b, 83c and 83d).

MEDIUM-7's rename is applied: test 80 was `..._after_the_reference_is_minted_...`, and revision 3
re-keyed the hold onto `paymentAttemptId` precisely BECAUSE the reference is not available in time
on the website path - `attempt["referenceId"]` there is the Razorpay order id, which does not exist
until after the gateway is addressed. A test named for the reference would assert the ordering the
design rejected.

The headline is test 69. An attempt carrying ONLY the Razorpay attributes and no gift-card key at
all must be FULLY SETTLED, because that is the ordinary path and the common path must need no write.
Revision 1 read `stage_rank(attempt) >= GC_NOT_REQUIRED_RANK` there, which is `0 >= 10` for an
ordinary attempt - so every non-gift-card order would have been not-fully-settled and the whole
checkout would have halted once wired.
