"""The two design-drift rules added on 2026-09-24, and the arithmetic under them.

Why these need tests when the gate itself is a test
---------------------------------------------------
`scan_token_mirror` compares a TypeScript literal against a CSS custom property, and
the two files legitimately spell the same colour differently: the contract writes body
text as `rgba(0,0,0,.898)` in one place and `#1a1a1a` in another, and those are the
same colour over white — exactly. So the comparison has to composite before it
compares.

That makes the rule only as good as `normalise_colour`. Get the arithmetic wrong in one
direction and the gate fires on two files that agree, which is the kind of noise that
gets a gate switched off. Get it wrong in the other and it passes two files that
disagree, which is the defect it exists to catch: `design-tokens.ts` said
`text: '#111827'` while `tokens.css` said `--text: #1a1a1a`, and because that file has
14 importers, primary text resolved to a retired blue-tinted grey in 14 files and to the
right colour everywhere else, decided by which system a component happened to read.
