"""The declared data model must not drift from the live tables again.

`amplify/data/resource.ts` reads like infrastructure and is a document: 58 models
declared, 0 AppSync APIs, 77 live tables provisioned by an entirely different
path. The failure mode is silent in both directions — a model for a table that
does not exist, and a live table nobody declared — and it had accumulated six of
the first kind before anything measured it.

These tests pin the reconciliation script itself, because a drift gate that is
wrong is worse than no gate: it either cries wolf until someone disables it, or
it passes while the two sides disagree.
