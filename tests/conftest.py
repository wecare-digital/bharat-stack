# NO AWS REGION DEFAULT HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
#
# This file briefly carried `os.environ.setdefault('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION', 'us-east-1')` to stop
# `botocore.exceptions.NoRegionError` during collection, which was failing 7 tests and with
# them the whole blocking `Route auth` gate. It was the wrong fix and it is removed.
#
# The cause was one handler constructing its DynamoDB resource at import time with no region
# argument, so importing the module reached for AWS configuration before any test ran.
# 39cfcf85 fixed that properly by building those resources lazily. Checked across the tree:
# 53 of the 54 handler files that touch boto3 at module scope already pass
# `region_name=os.environ.get('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1')` themselves - so a region fallback at
# the call site is the established convention here, and url-shortener was the lone outlier.
#
# A default in this file would have masked the next outlier instead of surfacing it: the suite
# would pass, and the handler would still be reaching for AWS config at import time where a
# Lambda cold start or a local run without AWS config would break. Keeping the environment bare
# is what makes that class of defect visible to the gate at all.
#
# So if a new test fails with NoRegionError, that is the signal working - fix the handler, not
# this file.

# monkeypatch `storage.table`, but `blog_sources` was compiled against a different `storage`
