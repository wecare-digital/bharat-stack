"""A rendered invoice must not be fetchable by URL.

An invoice PNG/PDF carries the customer's name, address, the amount and the GST breakdown.
It used to be written under `media_paths.public('stack/invoices/')` — the `o/` root, which
CloudFront serves with **no authentication** — and the API handed back
`https://{CDN_DOMAIN}/{s3_key}`, a permanent link. The exposure was bounded rather than
absent (the key embeds a 70-bit reference and bucket listing is off, so it was
unlisted-but-public: safe from enumeration, unsafe the moment a URL leaks) which is why it
was a P1 rather than a P0.

It moved to the gated root while `o/stack/invoices/` held **0 objects** and `InvoicesTable`
held **0 rows** — measured at the time. That timing is the point: once an invoice URL has
been delivered it cannot be retracted, which is the same argument `media_paths` records for
the 61 approved WhatsApp template URLs.

Four writers/readers had to move together, and a disagreement between any two would be worse
than the original state, because it would be inconsistent rather than uniformly wrong:

    invoice-engine            writes PNG + PDF, hands back the link
    inbound-whatsapp-handler  ALSO writes an invoice PNG on the payment path
    system-cleanup            sweeps the prefix; pointed at the wrong root it reports 0
                              objects, and 0 reads as "nothing to clean" rather than an error
    dashboard (frontend)      mirrors the cleanup prefix list

These are source-level assertions because the live behaviour needs AWS and CI has no
credentials. The live half was verified separately at the time of the change: a presigned GET
returns the object bytes, and the same key over CloudFront returns the SPA shell rather than
the object.
