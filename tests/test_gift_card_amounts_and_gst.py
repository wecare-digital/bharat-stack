"""A gift card is a PAYMENT METHOD, not a discount: the fee basis, the cap, and the six identities.

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/gift-cards-service-plugin-20261001.md`
sections 2 (DECISION 2 and the worked example), 4.1 (the split and the cap), 4.2 (the six
reconciliation identities), 4.4 (full cover is refused) and 4.5 (only `giftCards` is opened), and the
test list in section 9.1 (tests 87-100, including 95, 96, 97, 97a, 97b, 97c and 98).

Under GST a voucher is CONSIDERATION, not a reduction in the value of supply. The customer paid real
money for the card; redeeming it is tendering that money. So the taxable supply stays at its full
value and the 2.5% convenience fee and its 18% GST are computed on the FULL collection total - never
on the post-gift-card remainder. The worked example is `2500` and `450`; the wrong version is `1574`
and `283`, and it is recorded here so it is recognisable in review.

TWO TESTS ARE `xfail(strict=True)`, AND ONE THE BRIEF NAMED IS DELIBERATELY NOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tests 87 and 99 are marked against SEAM-G1: `cart_v2.calculate` refuses `giftCards` today, in the
same check that refuses `memberships` and `subscriptionCharges`, and that module belongs to the
cart_v2 workstream. DECISION 8: marked, never weakened, so each converts from pending to passing the
moment the seam lands and fails loudly if somebody satisfies it by lowering the bar. Both have an
UNCONDITIONAL companion asserting the half that does not depend on the seam.

Test 100 is NOT marked, and the reason is the same one that left the coupon suite's test 52a
unmarked. It asserts that `memberships` and `subscriptionCharges` are STILL refused - a property
that holds today and must never break. Marking it `strict=True` would make it xpass immediately,
which is a failure under this feature's own acceptance criterion, and worse it would switch off the
one assertion that fires if SEAM-G1 opens the gate for all three instead of narrowing it to one. The
design says as much in its own words: that refusal "must keep passing unchanged".

    taken and the quote frozen, which is the worst place for it.

    Two things are asserted, and the second is the stronger one:

    * the check EXISTS and fires, driven with a collection larger than the payable - an inconsistent
      input that could only come from a producer bug, which is exactly what a backstop is for;
    * under a well-formed quote the cap makes a sub-100 remainder UNREPRESENTABLE, because
      `remainder >= payable - (collection - 100) == fee + gst + 100`. Section 4.1 says the same of
      full cover: unrepresentable by construction rather than merely refused. The explicit check is
      retained anyway, as the backstop against a Wix view we did not predict.

    In both cases the table is a spy and records ZERO calls: the refusal precedes the hold.
