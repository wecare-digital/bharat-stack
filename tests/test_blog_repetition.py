"""Collection-level repetition: the failure where no two articles are duplicates.

THE TEST THAT JUSTIFIES THE MODULE.

`test_a_collection_of_individually_clean_articles_is_still_caught`. Every article in it passes
the per-article gate and the per-article dedupe, because no two of them overlap. They all open
the same way and they all use the same stock phrase once, which the per-article rule allows.
That is the signature of bulk generation, and a gate that only ever sees one record at a time
cannot see it at all.

`test_the_candidate_prefilter_is_exact_not_a_heuristic` is the other one. The pair sweep discards
pairs without comparing them, and it is only safe to do that because `sketch_jaccard` scores a
pair with no shared hash values at exactly zero. If that ever stopped being true, this module
would silently miss duplicates.
