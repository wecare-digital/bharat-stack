"""
The site-language handler had no test. These cover the two things that cost money.

WHY THESE AND NOT COVERAGE. This function is reachable without a session and it spends on a
metered API per character, so the assertions worth writing are the ones about who may spend:
that /translate refuses a caller which is not one of our pages, and that the two Polly routes
are gone rather than merely unused.

The handler is imported with boto3 clients stubbed. It builds a translate client, a Secrets
Manager client and a DynamoDB resource at module scope, so importing it unprepared either
reaches AWS or raises - neither of which belongs in a unit test.
