"""A rendering defect is HIGH when a customer can receive it, and only then.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. `scripts/rcs_template_sync.py --check` exits non-zero on any HIGH
finding. Until 2026-09-28 every rendering defect was flat HIGH, and one of them sat on
`get_started` — a template **no code path sends**, whose senders never existed. So the
gate returned 1 permanently, was wired into no workflow, and guarded nothing. The repo
already documents this failure mode for CodeQL in `tests/test_log_phone_masking.py`: a
check that fires on the safe majority trains people to ignore it.

Severity is now derived from reachability. The risk this creates is obvious and is what
these tests exist to prevent: reachability must not become a way to silence a defect that
actually matters. So the escalation direction is asserted as hard as the relaxation —
flipping a template to referenced must restore HIGH, and `rcsmenu`, the one template code
does send, must never be de-escalated.

No AWS or Sinch call is made. `validate()` is a pure function over exported rows.
