"""QA runs, gate sign-offs, and the four refusals that make a signature mean something.

THE THREE TESTS THAT CARRY THIS FILE.

`test_editing_the_body_invalidates_the_signoff_with_no_revocation_step` is the integrity
property. The gate is derived from the sign-off on every assessment and compared against the
body hash, so an edit after signing drops it automatically. The alternative - storing the gate
and revoking it on each write path - is a cleanup somebody has to remember at five call sites,
and the failure mode is an article certified by a signature over text nobody approved.

`test_a_signoff_is_refused_when_the_run_could_not_load_the_corpus`. Section 28 duplication needs
the 1,165-post index. A run without it reports NON_DUPLICATION having compared against nothing,
and a signature over that is a signature over nothing.

`test_a_blocking_finding_cannot_be_accepted_by_signature`. A human may accept a REVIEW - that is
what judgement is for. A BLOCK is a mechanical fact, and letting a signature override it would
make the mechanical half of the standard advisory.

#: A body that passes every mechanical rule, so a sign-off test is testing the sign-off.
#:
#: It took four rounds to get here, and each failure was the gate being right: 201 words against
#: the REFLECTION band of 500-800, a missing `originalSourceDate` that ARCHIVE_DERIVED requires,
#: the section 5 uniqueness declarations that nothing could write until this task, and the word
#: "reliability" tripping the legal-review trigger through the substring "liability". Three of
#: the four were fixed in the fixture. The fourth was a real defect in the gate and was fixed
#: there.
GOOD_BODY = """A person gives their word, and then the word does not hold. The response that
arrives first is moral. It is also useless, because it describes the person and leaves the
situation exactly where it was.

Something was counting on that word. A schedule had been built around it. Somebody else made a
decision on the strength of it, and committed something they cannot now recover. The word was
load-bearing, and the structure moved when it came out.

Workability asks a narrower question than goodness does. What became possible because the
commitment existed, and what stopped being possible when it failed? Those questions have
answers. The moral version mostly has verdicts.

Notice what changes when the question changes. Repair stops being an apology and becomes a
piece of work. Name what moved. Say what is now true. Rebuild the part of the arrangement that
had been resting on the word, and tell the people who were resting on it too. None of that
requires anybody to be good, and none of it is satisfied by feeling bad.

The distinction holds in the other direction. Somebody who keeps every promise inside an
arrangement where nothing depends on them has demonstrated very little. Dependability only
becomes visible where something rests on it, which is why it is tested by inconvenience and
not by intention. The easy promise is not evidence.

There is a second thing the moral reading hides. When a commitment fails, the people around it
start making private arrangements to cover the gap, and those arrangements outlast the original
failure. A team learns not to plan on a colleague. A supplier quietly builds in a week of
slack. None of it is announced, and all of it is expensive.

That is the cost worth naming, because it is the one nobody itemises. An apology addresses the
offence. It does not address the slack, the private workaround, or the plan somebody quietly
stopped making. Those come back only when the word starts holding again, and only after long
enough that planning on it stops feeling reckless.

So the question to ask after a broken commitment is not whether the person is sorry. It is what
other people have started doing differently, and what would have to happen for them to stop.
That is answerable, it is specific to the situation, and working through it produces something
an apology never does, which is an arrangement that holds the next time it is tested."""
