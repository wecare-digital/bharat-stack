"""Three payment paths that were too permissive, each in a way that was invisible.

Carried over as MEDIUM from the Phase 4d payment audit. None of them errored;
each produced a confident wrong answer.

1. `_mark_invoice_paid_by_phone_and_amount` matched on a float epsilon and, when
   several invoices matched, marked the OLDEST paid. Two pending invoices for the
   same phone with the same total is an ordinary repeat order, so that marked the
   wrong invoice paid AND left the real one outstanding.
2. `_get_next_invoice_number` fell back to `WD-PAY-TEMP-<uuid>` when the sequence
   counter was unreachable, putting a non-consecutive number into the GST series
   and returning it as an ordinary success.
3. Meta payment verification used a bool initialised True, so a capture that was
   never checked looked exactly like one Meta had confirmed.
