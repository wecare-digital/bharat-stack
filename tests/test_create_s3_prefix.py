"""Creating a folder must not be able to put private data in the public tree.

`scripts/create_s3_prefix.py` exists because S3 has no directories: `secure/stack/invoices/x.png`
is one flat key, and the "folders" a console shows are inferred from the `/` characters in keys
that already exist. So a prefix with no objects does not appear at all — which is what
`secure/stack/invoices/` looked like after the invoice assets moved to the gated root, since
invoices are rendered on demand and none had been.

A 0-byte key ending in `/` is the only thing S3 treats as a folder, and this codebase already
relies on that: `operations/system-cleanup._wipe_s3_prefix` deletes content but explicitly skips
keys ending in `/`, so a marked folder survives a purge while an unmarked one vanishes.

The risk being guarded
----------------------
The bucket has two roots with opposite meanings — `o/` is served by CloudFront with **no
authentication**, `secure/` is not — and both are composed through `lambda_utils.media_paths`.
A script that accepted a bare `stack/invoices/` would have to pick a root, and picking wrong
puts customer invoices on the public tree. So an unrooted prefix is REFUSED rather than
defaulted, and these tests pin that refusal.

Offline only: every case here is argument validation, so no AWS call and no credentials.
