"""Two scripts write the GitHub OIDC trust policy. They must write the same one.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. On 2026-09-27 the repository was renamed `bharat-stack` ->
`wecare-digital` and two deploy workflows went dark for 22 hours with

    Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity

which reads as a credentials fault and is not one. This repo was created after
2026-07-15, so it uses GitHub's immutable subject format:

    repo:OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID:ref:refs/heads/BRANCH

The ids survive a rename. The NAME segments are still in the string and do not.
Both trust policies pinned the whole string with `StringEquals`, so the rename
broke them.

THE REGRESSION THIS GUARDS, which is subtler than the original bug. After the
repair, `scripts/provision_ci_route_auth_role.py` still contained a name-pinned
`StringEquals` document *and* called `update_assume_role_policy` with it. Running
`--apply` for any unrelated reason would have silently reverted the hardening on
one of the three roles and re-armed the outage for the next rename. Nothing would
have failed at the time; the damage only appears on a rename, which is exactly the
kind of latent trap a test has to hold down.

So: both modules must emit a byte-identical document, and that document must not
pin a repository or owner NAME anywhere.

These assertions are pure data checks on module constants. No AWS call is made and
no credential is read, so this runs in CI with no permissions.
