"""The checkout-identity seam: the server's reply and the page's parser must be one shape.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
Phase 1 landed as four features that never share a file. Three of them agree on a contract by
restating it:

* ``ecommerce/checkout``'s ``action:"profile"`` reply (FEAT-002) is what ``src/pages/cart.tsx``
  parses as ``ProfileReply`` and projects onto ``CheckoutProfileValue`` (FEAT-003/FEAT-004);
* ``auth/customer-profile``'s save reply (FEAT-001) is projected onto the SAME
  ``CheckoutProfileValue`` by ``CheckoutProfile.tsx``, so a returning customer and a
  just-saved one must be describable by one type;
* ``contact_address.normalize_for_storage``'s return (FEAT-001) is what
  ``AddressFields.StoredAddress`` (FEAT-003) declares.

Every one of those is a copy across a language boundary, and each failure mode is SILENT. A
renamed server key does not break a build: ``String( reply.contactId || '' )`` yields ``''``, and
the identity card renders an empty row. A refusal string that drifts by one character stops
matching ``if ( status === ... )`` and falls through to the honest-but-useless UNRECOGNISED arm,
so a customer who needs the address editor is told the checkout could not be confirmed.

The four features each verified their own half. This holds the halves equal to each other.

Parsing
-------
The Python side is read from the **AST**, not with a regex: the keys are wanted as a closed set,
and only a parse can say that a dict literal has exactly these keys and no others. The TypeScript
side is read by brace-matching one named declaration, which is narrower than the repo's usual
``re.findall(r"'([^']+)'", source)`` because these blocks declare field names rather than string
literals.
