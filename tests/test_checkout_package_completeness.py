"""Every module the checkout path can reach must be IN the deployment ZIP.

The failure this guards against is specific and silent: a handler whose imports all resolve in
the repository, packaged without one of them, deploys cleanly and then fails on the first real
request with `Unable to import module 'handler'`. No build step catches it, because the build
step is the thing that dropped the file.

It also pins the inverse - what must NOT ship. Tests, `__pycache__` and dev dependencies in a
Lambda package are dead weight at best, and at worst a test fixture carrying a credential shape
inside a production artifact.

Two source roots, deliberately, because one of them is not enough
----------------------------------------------------------------
Most assertions here run against the WORKING TREE, which is the right scope for the packaging
question: "would a package built from this repository today be complete". But in this repo that
tree is shared by several concurrent sessions, so it routinely carries files that are modified or
untracked and belong to nobody here - and `build_zip` packages all of them. A suite that only ever
asserts over the working tree is therefore asserting over other people's in-flight edits, and can
go red or green for reasons that have nothing to do with packaging.

So `committed` builds the same package from `git archive HEAD`, and the completeness assertions run
against both. The working-tree build catches a packaging rule that started dropping a file; the
committed build is the one whose result is reproducible by anyone, on any machine, from the same
SHA. The deployed-revision evidence lives in docs/execution/checkout-deployment-20261001.md.
