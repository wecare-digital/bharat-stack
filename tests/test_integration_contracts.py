"""Phase 7.1 — the adapter contract, exercised over fixtures.

7.1's definition of done says it in the master prompt's own words: "Enable safe READ paths
only where the owner has supplied approved access; **otherwise complete fixtures/contracts
and mark the live read `WAITING_FOR_OWNER`**. Record scopes, ownership, quota, freshness and
provider request IDs where available."

So the owner-blocked half is a legitimate closing state, and what was missing was the
first half: nothing exercised the contract. `registry.py` described eight providers and
`ReadResult` defined how a read must report itself, and **no test drove either**. A contract
nobody runs is a docstring.

These tests use fixtures, never a network call, so they prove the read path's shape without
a credential — which is exactly what lets the live read be `WAITING_FOR_OWNER` rather than
unknown.

The five things the prompt names, and why each is checked
--------------------------------------------------------
* **ownership** — a registry without it cannot answer "who do we ask" when a read starts
  failing.
* **scopes** — and read-only separated from write-capable, because a scope that happens to
  read as read-only is how a write capability gets granted by accident. Two of the eight
  are only offered write-capable, and the registry's job is to make that visible, not to
  pretend it is safe.
* **quota** — as used/limit, not a percentage. "Can I make 400 more calls today" is the
  only question a caller has and a percentage cannot answer it. `None` (not reported) is a
  different state from `remaining == 0`.
* **freshness** — derived from the *provider's* max age, not a caller's opinion.
* **request id** — absent is recordable, fabricated is not. Without one there is no support
  conversation to have with Google or Meta.
