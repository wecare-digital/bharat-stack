"""What `POST /ecommerce/checkout` with `action=create` can and cannot do while the gate is off.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The deployment brief named one literal deliverable: `action=create` must answer
`PAYMENT_INITIATION_DISABLED` rather than 404. It does not, and cannot, be observed from outside:
`handler.handler` calls `customer_auth.require_customer` before it parses the body, so an
unauthenticated probe gets 401 and never reaches the branch; and inside `_create` the readiness
evaluation precedes the gate, so with both `EXPECTED_*` inputs empty an authenticated request gets
409 `payment_unavailable` before the gate is consulted.

Making the literal probe observable would mean weakening authentication or reordering the handler.
Both change what the endpoint does, so neither was done. What was done instead is this file: the
branch is pinned by assertion, and the two structural facts that make the probe unreachable are
pinned too, so the substitution recorded in docs/execution/checkout-deployment-20261001.md is
machine-checked rather than taken on trust. The accompanying artifact is
docs/execution/snapshots/checkout-gate-ordering-20261001.json, measured from the bytes on the
`live` alias rather than from this working tree.

The direction these assertions fail in
--------------------------------------
`test_no_new_side_effect_creeps_in_before_the_gate` is a SUBSET assertion, deliberately. Moving the
gate earlier, or removing a side effect from in front of it, makes the endpoint more inert and must
not turn the suite red. Adding a NEW side effect ahead of the gate is the dangerous direction - that
is how "initiation is off" quietly stops meaning "nothing happens" - and that is what fails here.
