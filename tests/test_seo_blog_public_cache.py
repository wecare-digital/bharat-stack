"""The public blog read surface: caching, projection, conditional requests, upstream failure.

WHY THESE EXIST. This endpoint took 185,576 requests in 24 hours on 2026-09-28 - the
hottest in the account - and it reached the API Gateway 30-second ceiling, logging
`30001ms status=503`. The cause was arithmetic rather than a slow network: every request
re-fetched the Wix category and tag maps, and the list path walked 9 sequential pages, each
with a 30-second timeout, against a 30-second budget.

The fix has three layers and each one can regress silently, so each one is pinned here:

  the per-sandbox caches in wix.py        a warm request must make NO upstream call
  serve-stale-on-failure                  an upstream 503 must not empty the blog
  the ?fields= projection and the ETag    the response must shrink, and 304 must work

The stale-serving test is the one that matters most. `scripts/generate-sitemap.js` refuses
to write a sitemap with zero posts precisely because a two-second network blip once
produced one, and that guard is the last line rather than the first.
