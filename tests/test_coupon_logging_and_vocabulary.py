"""What the coupon handler may and may not put in a log line.

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/coupons-20261001.md` section 7
(tests 59-61) and section 9 (the vocabulary gate).

The asymmetry these two tests protect is deliberate and runs in OPPOSITE directions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The Wix API key must not appear in a logging expression AT ALL - not "must not be logged".
  CodeQL's `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` failed this repository's build twice on a line
  that could not leak anything (`"google" if key else "aws"`), and it was right to: the analysis
  cannot prove the value is discarded, and neither can a reviewer at a glance. It also tracks
  taint across function boundaries, so reducing a secret to a bool in a helper does not launder
  it. Hence test 59 walks transitively.
* A coupon code MAY be logged in full. It is broadcast marketing material, printed in campaigns
  and shared deliberately - the exact opposite of a gift-card code, where the same position is
  occupied by an HMAC. Test 60 exists so a later "harden the logging" pass has to read this
  paragraph before masking the one correlation id this path has.
