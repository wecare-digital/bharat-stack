# Meta Graph API version audit — 2026-10-01

**Scope.** Every Meta Graph call this repository makes, checked against the v26.0 changelog
and current Meta developer documentation, to decide whether the pinned `v25.0` default can
move and what breaks on **27 October 2026**.

**Headline verdict.** This repository calls **none** of the surfaces v26.0 restricts. The
bump to **v26.0** is clear on documentation evidence, with one companion change and one
unverified item named below. Equally important, and the opposite of what the brief that
commissioned this work assumed:

> **27 October 2026 breaks no call this repository makes.** It expires the *recorded
> justification* for the pin, which escalates `scripts/check-versions.ts` from `warn` to
> `error`. The deadline is a CI and governance deadline, not an outage deadline. `v25.0`
> itself remains callable until **2028-07-29**.

That distinction is the single most useful output of this audit, because it changes the
response from "emergency migration" to "scheduled bump plus one ads fix".

## 1. What Meta actually restricted

Source: [Graph API v26.0 changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version26.0),
fetched 2026-10-01. Released 29 July 2026.

| Restriction | Applies to v26.0+ from | Applies to ALL remaining versions from | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Commerce Order Management API** — 47 endpoints | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** | **None** |
| **Legacy Graph protocol features** — `pretty`, `debug`, `date_format`, root `GET /?ids=`, `If-None-Match`/ETag/304 | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** | Per-feature; see below |
| Marketing API **Delivery Estimate** fields `daily_outcomes_curve`, `budget_guardrail`, `estimate_dau` | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** | None |
| Marketing API **Web+App destination** `applink_treatment=web_only` | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** | Automatic/compatible destination |
| Marketing API **Messenger Stories** `story` in `messenger_positions` | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** (incl. unversioned) | Remove; Advantage+ unaffected |
| Marketing API **Poll ads** `poll_spec`, poll in `interactive_components_spec` | 2026-07-29 | **2026-10-27** | None |
| Instagram **Explore Feed** placement | 2026-07-29 | not stated | Other eligible placements |
| **Rights Manager** owner fields | 2026-07-29 | v25.0 keeps them 2 years | `*_rh_owner` / `*_owner` fields |
| **Page** legacy fields for New Pages Experience (`current_location`, `genre`, `network`, `parking`, `start_info`, `settings`) | 2026-07-29 | ~90 days after launch, **TBD** | None |
| **Advantage+ Audience** explicit `advantage_audience` for HEC-F relaxable targeting | 2026-07-29 | once v25.0 deprecated, **TBD** | Set the field explicitly |
| **Shop Ads** creatives default to `destination_spec.destination_type = WEBSITE_AND_SHOP` | 2026-07-29 | n/a — behaviour change, not a removal | `WEBSITE_AND_SHOP_OPT_OUT` |

The 47 deprecated Commerce Order Management endpoints are, without exception, shaped
`/{commerce-order-id}/…`, `/{order-id}/…`, `/{order-item-id}/…`, `/{shipment-id}/…`,
`/{refund-id}/…`, `/{cancellation-id}/…`, `/{commerce-merchant-settings-id}/…`,
`/{tax-settings-id}/…`, `/{transaction-detail-id}`, `/{commerce-return-id}`,
`/{commerce-address-id}`, `/{cancel-reason-id}`, `/{payment-id}/items` and
`/{page-id}/commerce_orders`. The stated cause is that **checkout directly on Facebook and
Instagram for Shops has been sunset**, so the underlying commerce-order infrastructure is
being retired. Content was rephrased for compliance with licensing restrictions.

**Version lifecycle**, from the
[Graph API changelog index](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog)
(fetched 2026-10-01): latest is **v26.0** (introduced 2026-07-29, available until TBD).
**v25.0** was introduced 2026-02-18 and is **available until 2028-07-29**. There is no
v27.0. The scheduled removals are v20.0 on 2026-09-24 and v21.0 on 2027-01-21.

**Correction to a repo comment.** `whatsapp-business-api/handler.py:2976` records a live
Block API check as "v25.0/v26.0/v27.0 all agree". **v27.0 does not exist** per the
changelog index above. The v25.0 and v26.0 halves of that claim are consistent with the
documentation; the v27.0 half cannot be true and should be struck. Severity INFORMATIONAL
— it is a comment, not a code path.

### The WhatsApp changelog carries no v26.0 restriction

The [WhatsApp Business Platform changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-platform/changelog)
(fetched 2026-10-01, 110 KB, full text searched) contains **no occurrence of "v26"**,
"version 26", or "26.0"; **no** catalog deprecation; and **no** mention of Commerce Order
Management. The Commerce Order Management deprecation is a Facebook/Instagram Shops
retirement, not a WhatsApp one.

Two live items from that changelog that do bear on this repo:

- **`paid_messaging_account_id` → `messaging_account_id`.** The old parameter is a
  deprecated backward-compatible alias; migrate by **2026-12-31**, after which it is
  planned for removal in a future Graph version. **This repo uses neither name** —
  verified by grep across `amplify/`, `src/`, `packages/`, `config/`. Nothing to do.
- **Orders API is alive and being extended.** A 2026-09-10 entry adds `offsite_card_pay`
  to `payment_settings.type` alongside `pix_dynamic_code`, `payment_link` and `boleto`.
  The WhatsApp Orders API (`order_details` interactive messages) is therefore **not** the
  deprecated Commerce Order Management API, and this repo's `_build_payment_settings`
  path is unaffected.

---

## 2. Every Meta Graph call this repo makes

**18** Lambda functions plus 3 scripts and the frontend. ~50 distinct endpoints. Enumerated by
following `lambda_utils/meta_version.py`'s importers and by grepping every URL-assembly
site under `amplify/functions`.

Verdict key: **OK** = not in any restricted set, verified against the changelog above.

### 2.1 Cloud API — messaging, media, phone number (production-critical)

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/messages` | all outbound messaging, **OTP template sends**, order_details, catalog messages, typing | `outbound-whatsapp`, `inbound-whatsapp-handler`, `whatsapp-business-api`, `whatsapp-calling`, `whatsapp-voice`, `bulk-worker`, `voice-in/c2c`, `voice-in/obd`, `whatsapp-template-management`, `whatsapp-templates`, `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/media` | media upload | `outbound-whatsapp`, `whatsapp-voice`, `whatsapp-business-api`, `whatsapp-templates`, `whatsapp-template-management` | **OK** |
| `GET /{media-id}` | resolve media URL | `inbound-whatsapp-handler`, `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `DELETE /{media-id}` | retention cleanup | `media-cleanup`, `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET /{phone-number-id}` (`display_phone_number`, `verified_name`, `quality_rating`, `status`, `messaging_limit_tier`, `is_official_business_account`, `name_status`, `code_verification_status`) | number health | `whatsapp-business-api`, `meta-analytics`, `meta-business-agent`, `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{phone-number-id}/whatsapp_business_profile` | business profile | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{phone-number-id}/settings` | number settings | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |

| `GET\|POST\|DELETE /{phone-number-id}/username`, `GET …/username_suggestions` | username lifecycle | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/conversational_automation` | ice-breakers, commands | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{phone-number-id}/message_qrdls`, `DELETE …/message_qrdls/{qr-id}` | QR deep links | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/marketing_messages` | MM Lite send | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/register` | number registration | `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{phone-number-id}/groups`, `GET\|POST\|DELETE /{group-id}`, `/{group-id}/invite_link`, `/{group-id}/join_requests` | Groups API | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |

### 2.2 Business Management API — templates, flows, analytics, WABA assets

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET\|POST /{waba-id}/message_templates` | **OTP/AUTHENTICATION template** CRUD, listing |  `whatsapp-templates`, `whatsapp-template-management`, `whatsapp-business-api`, `ai-generate-response:5123` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST\|DELETE /{template-id}` | template read/edit/delete, `message_send_ttl_seconds` | same | **OK** |
| `POST /{waba-id}/message_samples` | template sample upload | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST\|DELETE /{waba-id}/subscribed_apps` | webhook subscription | `whatsapp-business-api`, `meta-business-agent`, `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `GET /{waba-id}/assigned_users`, `GET /{user-id}/assigned_whatsapp_business_accounts` | permissions | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{waba-id}/schedules` | scheduled sends | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET /{waba-id}?fields=analytics(…)`, conversation / pricing / template analytics | reporting | `meta-analytics`, `meta-business-agent`, `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `POST /{waba-id}/dataset`, `POST /{dataset-id}/events` | CAPI for WhatsApp | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{waba-id}/flows`, `GET\|POST\|DELETE /{flow-id}`, `POST /{flow-id}/publish`, `POST /{flow-id}/assets`, `POST /{waba-id}/migrate_flows` | Flows | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET /{business-portfolio-id}/owned_whatsapp_business_accounts`, `…/client_whatsapp_business_accounts` | portfolio inventory | `meta-business-agent` | **OK** |
| `GET /{business-id}/instagram_accounts` | IG linkage | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |

### 2.3 Catalog and commerce settings — the surfaces the old pin feared

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET\|POST /{waba-id}/product_catalogs` | list/attach catalog | `catalog-management` | **OK — not in the 47** |
| `GET\|POST /{catalog-id}/products` | product read/create, agent product lookup | `catalog-management`, `whatsapp-business-api`, `inbound-whatsapp-handler`, `meta-business-agent` | **OK — not in the 47** |
| `POST\|DELETE /{product-id}` | product update/delete, `image_fetch_status` | `catalog-management`, `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK — not in the 47** |
| `GET\|POST /{catalog-id}/product_feeds`, `POST /{feed-id}/uploads`, `GET\|POST /{feed-id}` | feed sync + schedule | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK — not in the 47** |
| `GET\|POST /{phone-number-id}/whatsapp_commerce_settings` | cart / storefront toggle | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK — not in the 47** |

**This is the finding that unblocks the version decision.** The pin's recorded reason —
`meta-business-agent/handler.py:230-234`, "Deliberately NOT v26.0: that release blocked a
batch of commerce endpoints, and `_tool_product_lookup` below reads
`/{catalog_id}/products`" — does not survive contact with the changelog.
`/{catalog-id}/products` is the **Product Catalog** API on the `ProductCatalog` node. The
47 deprecated endpoints are **Commerce *Order* Management** on `commerce-order`,
`order-item`, `shipment`, `refund`, `cancellation` and `commerce-merchant-settings` nodes.
Different product, different nodes, different cause. The WhatsApp catalog surface remains
documented and current — see
[Set Commerce Settings](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/set-commerce-settings),
[Share products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/sell-products-and-services/share-products/)
and the
[WABA > product_catalogs reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/whats-app-business-account/product_catalogs/).

`packages/config/vendorVersions.ts:85-104` reached the same conclusion independently on
2026-09-26. This audit confirms it against a fresh fetch of the changelog and extends it
with the live-configuration measurement in §4.

### 2.4 WhatsApp Payments (India) — the money path, and the easiest thing to misread

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /{waba-id}/payment_configurations` (`configuration_name`, `status`, `payment_gateway`, `merchant_category_code`, `purpose_code`) | readiness check; MCC 7392, purpose code 03 | `whatsapp-business-api` (incl. `payment_readiness.evaluate`) | **OK** |
| `GET /{phone-number-id}/payments/{configuration-name}/{reference-id}` | authoritative payment status lookup; the branch that can record `REJECTED_MISMATCH` | `inbound-whatsapp-handler:3445`, `whatsapp-business-api:_payment_lookup` | **OK** |
| `POST /{phone-number-id}/payments_refund` | refund initiation — **code present, prohibited by steering, must not be invoked** | `whatsapp-business-api:_payment_refund` | **OK** (unaffected by v26.0; prohibition is a project rule, not a Meta one) |

**Do not confuse these with the deprecated set.** The 47 include `GET /{order-id}/payment`,
`GET /{commerce-order-id}/payments`, `GET /{payment-id}/items`, `GET /{refund-id}`,
`GET /{refund-id}/amount` and `GET /{refund-id}/items`. Ours hang off the **business phone
number** node and belong to the
[WhatsApp Payments API (India)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/payments-api/payments-in),
a separate and currently-documented product. The node differs, the product differs, and
the sunset cause (Facebook/Instagram Shops checkout) does not apply. A careless
string-match on "payments" or "refund" would have produced a false blocker here, on the
one path where a wrong call refuses real money.

### 2.5 App, auth and webhook control plane

| Endpoint | Purpose | Callers | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /oauth/access_token` | token exchange / refresh | `partner-token-refresh`, `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `GET /me` | token liveness probe | `scripts/check_secrets_live.py` | **OK** |
| `GET /{app-id}` | app-token probe | `scripts/check_secrets_live.py` | **OK** |
| `POST /{app-id}/uploads`, `POST /{upload-session-id}` | resumable upload (template headers) | `whatsapp-business-api` | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /{app-id}/subscriptions` | webhook field subscription | `scripts/meta_webhook_control_plane.py` | **OK** (but see §4, hard-coded **v23.0**) |
| `GET /debug_token` | token introspection | `.kiro/skills/debug-access-token/scripts/debug_token_probe.py` | **OK — explicitly exempted** by the changelog's `debug` deprecation |
| `POST /{extended-credit-id}/whatsapp_credit_sharing_and_attach` | credit line attach | `partner-onboarding` | **OK** |
| `POST /{entity-id}/agent_onboarding` | AI agent onboarding | `meta-business-agent` | **OK** |

### 2.6 Marketing API — the only place v26.0 changes behaviour

| Endpoint | Purpose | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /me/adaccounts` (`id,account_id,name,account_status,currency`) | account listing | **OK** |
| `GET /{business-portfolio-id}/owned_pages` (`id,name,connected_whatsapp_business_account`) | page listing | **OK** — none of the five deprecated New Pages fields, and not `settings` |
| `POST /act_{ad-account-id}/adimages` | image upload | **OK** |
| `GET\|POST /act_{ad-account-id}/campaigns` | campaign CRUD | **OK** |
| `POST /act_{ad-account-id}/adsets` | ad set create (`destination_type: WHATSAPP`, `optimization_goal: CONVERSATIONS`, PAUSED default) | **OK** — see Advantage+ note |
| `POST /act_{ad-account-id}/adcreatives` | creative create | ⚠️ **behaviour change** |
| `GET\|POST /act_{ad-account-id}/ads`, `GET\|POST /{ad-id}` | ad CRUD, status | ⚠️ **behaviour change** |

Verified **absent** from the entire repo by grep (`amplify/`, `src/`, `packages/`,
`scripts/`, `config/`): `delivery_estimate`, `daily_outcomes_curve`, `budget_guardrail`,
`estimate_dau`, `poll_spec`, `interactive_components_spec`, `applink_treatment`,
`messenger_positions`, `destination_spec`, `publisher_platforms`, `facebook_positions`,
`instagram_positions`. So four of the five "all remaining versions on 2026-10-27" Marketing
API removals cannot touch this repo, and the Explore placement removal cannot either.

Two conditional items remain:

- ⚠️ **Shop Ads defaulting (MEDIUM).** From v26.0, an eligible creative defaults to
  `destination_spec.destination_type = WEBSITE_AND_SHOP` when the advertiser has a shop.
  `marketing-ads/handler.py:_creative_create` sets no `destination_spec` at all; it builds
  an `object_story_spec` with `call_to_action: WHATSAPP_MESSAGE` /
  `app_destination: WHATSAPP` and `link: https://api.whatsapp.com/send`. Whether a
  WhatsApp-destination creative is "eligible" is **not stated** in the changelog, so this
  is a genuine unknown rather than a cleared item. Mitigation: set `destination_spec`
  explicitly, using `WEBSITE_AND_SHOP_OPT_OUT` if the WhatsApp destination must be
  preserved. Blast radius is bounded — ad sets and ads default to `PAUSED`, and activating
  ad spend is a standing prohibition — but a silent destination change on a money surface
  is not acceptable to carry unexamined.
- ➖ **Advantage+ Audience for HEC-F (NOT APPLICABLE).** Only bites when creating a
  Housing, Employment, or Financial-products ad set with relaxable targeting.
  `_adset_create` builds `destination_type: WHATSAPP` with `optimization_goal` in the
  CONVERSATIONS family and targeting `{geo_locations: {countries: ['IN']}}`. Not HEC-F.
  Record the conditional; no change needed.

### 2.7 Protocol-level features — verified clean, and this is the one that would have hurt

The five legacy protocol removals apply to **all remaining supported versions** on
2026-10-27 and are **not** commerce-specific, so pinning to v25.0 never protected against
them. Grepped across `amplify/`, `scripts/`, `packages/`, `src/`:

| Feature | Present? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `pretty` query parameter | **No** | zero matches |
| `debug` query parameter | **No** | only Python logging levels and npm `debug` package; `debug_token` is exempted anyway |
| `date_format` | **No** | zero matches |
| Root `GET /?ids=…` | **No** | zero matches |
| `If-None-Match` / ETag / 304 | **No** | only `googleEtag` in `identity/google_people.py` (Google People API, unrelated) |

Had any of these been present, the 27 October date would have been a real outage date for
this repo regardless of the pinned version. They are not.

---

## 3. Affected calls, replacements, and blockers

**Affected calls: zero.** No endpoint in §2 appears in the 47 deprecated Commerce Order
Management endpoints, uses a removed Marketing API field, or relies on a removed protocol
feature.

**Therefore there is no replacement work and no provider blocker.** Stated plainly so it
is not mistaken for an unexamined gap: there is no call for which a replacement is needed,
and no call for which Meta offers none. The one open behavioural item is Shop Ads
defaulting (§2.6), which is a change in silent defaults rather than a removal, and has a
documented opt-out (`WEBSITE_AND_SHOP_OPT_OUT`).

**What 27 October 2026 actually does to this repository:**

| Consequence | Severity | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Any Meta call fails | **None** | No restricted surface is called. |
| `scripts/check-versions.ts` starts failing CI | **HIGH** | `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts:119` sets `lagExpiresOn: '2026-10-27'`; `checkVersions` escalates `warn` → `error` once that date passes (`vendorVersions.ts:458-465`), and `check-versions.ts` exits non-zero on any error finding. |
| `v25.0` stops working | **None until 2028-07-29** | Per the changelog index. |

---

## 4. Configuration defects found — the version has more than two sources of truth

The brief named one duplication. There are **six** independent routes by which a Graph
version reaches a runtime, and two of them bypass `meta_version.py`'s validation entirely.

| # | Source | Value | Validated by `meta_version`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `lambda_utils/meta_version.py:51` `_DEFAULT` | `v25.0` | **yes — it is the validator** |
| 2 | `lambda_utils/whatsapp_types.py:4` `DEFAULT_API_VERSION` | `v25.0` | **no** — independent literal |
| 3 | `META_API_VERSION` env var | `v25.0` on 4 functions | **yes** — module reads and validates it |
| 4 | `META_GRAPH_BASE` env var | `https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0` on 1 function | **NO — full URL, never shape-checked** |
| 5 | `config/vendor-versions.json` `metaGraphApiVersion` / `metaGraphApiBase` | `v25.0` | **no** — but pinned equal by `test_meta_version.py` |
| 6 | `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts` `META_GRAPH.configured` | `v25.0` | **no** — generates #5 |

### 4.1 `META_GRAPH_BASE` is a validation bypass — CRITICAL for a bump

Measured live on 2026-10-01 across the whole fleet (**68 functions enumerated,
0 errors**, `ListFunctions` + `GetFunctionConfiguration`). Exactly five functions carry a
version key:

```
wecare-marketing-ads          META_GRAPH_BASE   = https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0
wecare-partner-onboarding     META_API_VERSION  = v25.0
wecare-partner-token-refresh  META_API_VERSION  = v25.0
wecare-whatsapp-business-api  META_API_VERSION  = v25.0
wecare-whatsapp-calling       META_API_VERSION  = v25.0
```

Two handlers read `META_GRAPH_BASE` and let it **win over** the validated module value:

```python
# marketing-ads/handler.py:47  and  meta-business-agent/handler.py:236
GRAPH = os.environ.get("META_GRAPH_BASE", GRAPH_BASE)
```

Three consequences, all load-bearing:

1. **A bump of `_DEFAULT` alone moves almost nothing.** The four functions with an explicit
   `META_API_VERSION` keep v25.0 because the env var wins, and `wecare-marketing-ads`
   keeps v25.0 because `META_GRAPH_BASE` wins. Only `wecare-meta-business-agent` — which
   carries **neither** key live — would actually follow. Editing one constant and
   declaring the fleet bumped would be wrong, and wrong in the direction that produces no
   error.
2. **`META_GRAPH_BASE` defeats the module's entire purpose.** Its value is a full URL, so
   `_VERSION_RE` never sees it. `META_GRAPH_BASE=https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0.1` —
   exactly the malformed shape `meta_version.py` exists to refuse at config time — sails
   through and produces a Graph 400 at request time. The repo's second-highest-risk
   version route is its only unvalidated one.
3. **It is also the mitigation for §2.6.** A deliberate per-function pin is a genuinely
   useful capability: it lets the fleet move to v26.0 while `wecare-marketing-ads` stays
   on v25.0 until the Shop Ads `destination_spec` question is settled. So the fix is to
   **validate the override, not remove it**.

### 4.2 `whatsapp_types.py:3-4` is a dead second opinion — delete, do not re-export

`DEFAULT_API_VERSION = 'v25.0'` and `GRAPH_BASE = 'https://graph.facebook.com'` are
independent literals that `test_meta_version.py` does not catch, because
`test_no_handler_declares_its_own_version` matches the name `META_API_VERSION` and these
are spelled differently. They are only coincidentally correct today.

**Measured: both have zero importers.** `grep -rn "whatsapp_types" amplify/ tests/ scripts/`
finds exactly two importers, `template_validation.py:16` and `template_ttl.py:16`, and both
import template constants (`TTL_BOUNDS`, `TTL_NEG1_ALLOWED`, categories, button types) — not
the version. `meta_client.py:39` does define a `DEFAULT_API_VERSION`, but from
`meta_version`, not from here. So these two lines are dead code that reads as configuration.

**Delete them rather than re-exporting from `meta_version`.** A re-export would add
`whatsapp_types → meta_version` to the Lambda packaging closure, and `whatsapp_types` is
reached transitively by every function that bundles `template_ttl` or `template_validation`
(`scripts/provision_checkout.py:706` documents that closure and
`tests/test_provision_checkout_contract.py:717` asserts the `template_ttl → whatsapp_types`
edge). Deleting removes the duplicate source of truth without widening the closure;
re-exporting would fix the duplication and enlarge the blast radius of a `meta_version`
import error at the same time. Deleting is strictly better.

Note that `meta-business-agent/handler.py:230-231` cites `whatsapp_types.py` as a version
authority in a comment — a second-order symptom of the same defect, and another reason the
literals should not merely be updated to `v26.0`.

### 4.3 Hard-coded versions in scripts — outside the test's reach

`test_meta_version.py` walks `amplify/functions` only, so `scripts/` is unguarded:

| File | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/meta_webhook_control_plane.py:58` | **`v23.0`** | three versions behind; `GET\|POST /{app-id}/subscriptions` |
| `scripts/meta_webhook_audit.py:17` | `v25.0` | |
| `scripts/check_secrets_live.py:79,89` | `v25.0` | |

Severity LOW for correctness (both endpoints answer on v23.0 and are not restricted), but
it means "the repo is on v25.0" is not true of the tooling. Out of this task's owned paths.

### 4.4 Frontend and IaC literals — out of owned paths, recorded for a follow-up

`src/pages/_app.tsx:1322,1393` (FB JS SDK init), `src/components/wa/selectors.tsx:39`
(`GRAPH_VERSIONS` picker list, newest entry `v25.0`), `src/components/EmbeddedSignupPanel.tsx:13`,
`src/pages/workspace/engage/whatsapp/template-builder.tsx:231` (curl preview),
`src/pages/workspace/dashboard/index.tsx:285` (user-visible "via Meta Graph API v25.0"),
`amplify/functions/shared/config.ts:66`, `amplify/functions/messaging/meta-analytics/resource.ts:15`,
`amplify/functions/ecommerce/catalog-management/resource.ts:11`.

## 5. Version decision

**Recommend moving the default to `v26.0`**, satisfying the brief's criterion 4: every call
this repo makes is unaffected, so the current version is safe.

Justification, in order of weight:

1. **Zero affected calls.** §2 enumerates ~50 distinct endpoints across 18 functions and 3
   scripts. None is among the 47 Commerce Order Management endpoints, none uses a removed
   Marketing API field, none uses a removed protocol feature. Verified by grep, not assumed.
2. **The pin's recorded reason is false.** `meta-business-agent/handler.py:233-234` names `/{catalog_id}/products` as blocked.
   The changelog blocks Commerce *Order* Management. A pin resting on a false premise is
   worse than no pin, because it reads as a deliberate decision and so does not get
   re-examined.
3. **The pin expires anyway.** `lagExpiresOn: '2026-10-27'` makes `check-versions` fail CI
   from that date. Keeping v25.0 past 27 October requires editing the gate to accept a new
   reason — and the only honest new reason would be "we have not live-tested v26.0", which
   is an argument for testing, not for pinning.
4. **The version-removal clock is not the pressure.** v25.0 lives until 2028-07-29. This
   bump is about correctness of the recorded rationale and about not carrying an expired
   justification, not about avoiding an outage.

### What must be true before the bump reaches production

The code change is safe; **the deploy is the part that needs gating**, and it is outside
this task's scope (no deploy, no push).

| Gate | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Doc audit clears every endpoint | ✅ **this document** | done |
| Live v26.0 round trip: AUTHENTICATION/OTP template send, `GET /{phone}/payments/{cfg}/{ref}`, `GET /{catalog-id}/products` | ⏳ **NOT DONE — the one thing this audit could not verify** | needs a deploy + QA send to `+918100640044` |
| `wecare-marketing-ads` either keeps an explicit v25.0 pin, or `marketing-ads/handler.py` sets `destination_spec` explicitly | ⏳ **PENDING** | `marketing-ads/handler.py` is not an owned path here |
| All 5 live env keys updated with the deploy | ⏳ **PENDING** | §4.1 — a `_DEFAULT` edit alone does not move them |

**The recommended landing sequence is: code change now (this task), live verification and
env/deploy later, as a separate authorized step.** Because four functions pin
`META_API_VERSION=v25.0` and one pins `META_GRAPH_BASE` live, merging the `_DEFAULT` change
does **not** move those five — which makes this a genuinely low-risk commit rather than a
silent production flip. `wecare-meta-business-agent` is the exception: it carries neither
key, so it follows `_DEFAULT` on its next deploy. That function's Graph calls are
`subscribed_apps`, portfolio listing, phone fields, analytics and `/{catalog_id}/products`
— all cleared in §2, and its catalog call is precisely the one the false pin was protecting.

### What I verified, and what I did not

**Verified:**
- v26.0 changelog fetched in full from `developers.facebook.com` on 2026-10-01; the 47
  endpoints read individually and matched against the repo's enumeration.
- Version lifecycle (latest = v26.0, v25.0 until 2028-07-29, no v27.0) from the changelog
  index, fetched same day.
- WhatsApp Business Platform changelog fetched in full (110 KB) and searched: no v26.0
  reference, no catalog deprecation, no Commerce Order Management mention.
- Endpoint enumeration by grep over `amplify/functions/**/*.py`, resolving each dynamic
  `{endpoint}` argument at its call sites.
- Absence of all five protocol features and all removed Marketing API fields, by grep.
- Live Lambda configuration: 68 functions enumerated, 0 errors, exactly 5 carrying a
  version key, values as listed in §4.1.
- `tests/test_meta_version.py`: **18 passed** on the current tree — the baseline is green,
  so a later failure is attributable to this change.

**NOT verified — treat as open:**
- **No live Graph call was made on v26.0 from this repo.** Doing so requires a real token,
  and reading a credential is prohibited. The doc audit is necessary but is not a round
  trip. `vendorVersions.ts:96-98` records the same gap. This is the single largest residual
  risk and it sits on the OTP path.
- **Shop Ads eligibility** for a WhatsApp-destination creative is not stated in the
  changelog (§2.6).
- The `settings` edge removal date for New Pages Experience is "TBD" in the changelog; the
  repo does not call it, so this is recorded rather than tracked.
- Whether Meta's documented behaviour matches runtime for `/{catalog-id}/products` on
  v26.0. Documentation says current; only a call proves it.

## 6. Implementation plan

Owned paths: `amplify/functions/shared/lambda_utils/meta_version.py`,
`amplify/functions/shared/lambda_utils/whatsapp_types.py`,
`config/lambda-env-manifest.json` **version keys only**, and new tests under `tests/`.
Anything else is recorded as a follow-up, not edited.

Run everything with `/Users/wecaredigital/wecare-store/.venv/bin/python` — bare `python`
is not on PATH. Do not push, do not deploy.

- [ ] **1. Teach `meta_version.py` to own and validate `META_GRAPH_BASE`.**
      Add a `_resolve_base()` that reads `META_GRAPH_BASE`; when set, require it to match
      `^https://graph\.facebook\.com/v\d{1,3}\.\d$`, extract the version into
      `META_API_VERSION`, and raise `MetaVersionError` otherwise. When absent, behave
      exactly as today. Keep `META_API_VERSION`, `GRAPH_BASE`, `GRAPH_HOST`, `graph_url`
      and `is_valid_version` as they are — this **extends** the validation surface, it does
      not loosen it. If both `META_API_VERSION` and `META_GRAPH_BASE` are set and disagree,
      raise rather than pick a winner: a silent precedence rule is how §4.1 happened. Add
      `base_version(candidate: str) -> str` returning the extracted version or `''`, so
      the gate and health endpoints can reuse the parse. Document in the module docstring
      that `META_GRAPH_BASE` exists so a single function can be pinned deliberately (the
      §2.6 ads case), which is why it is validated rather than removed.
      Files: `amplify/functions/shared/lambda_utils/meta_version.py`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_meta_version.py -q` — 18 existing
      tests still pass.

- [ ] **2. Move the default to `v26.0` and keep the three in-repo sources in step.**
      Set `_DEFAULT = "v26.0"` in `meta_version.py` and update its docstring and docstring
      examples (`graph_url` example, the `https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0` comment, the
      `'v25.0'` in the error message) to `v26.0`. Update
      `config/vendor-versions.json` → `metaGraphApiVersion: "v26.0"`,
      `metaGraphApiBase: "https://graph.facebook.com/v26.0"`, and
      `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts` → `META_GRAPH.configured: 'v26.0'`,
      `verifiedOn: '2026-10-01'`, and **remove** `upgradeBlockedReason` and `lagExpiresOn`
      (no lag remains, and leaving an expired justification in place is what §5 argues
      against). `vendor-versions.json` is generated — regenerate it rather than hand-editing
      if `scripts/check-versions.ts --write` runs cleanly; `test_meta_version.py` asserts
      the two agree either way. `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts` and
      `config/vendor-versions.json` are outside the stated owned paths: if the owning
      session holds them, leave both and **do not** bump `_DEFAULT` in this step, because
      `test_python_and_vendor_versions_json_agree` will fail — see item 7.
      Files: `amplify/functions/shared/lambda_utils/meta_version.py`,
      `config/vendor-versions.json`, `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_meta_version.py -q` passes, and
      `node scripts/check-versions.ts` exits 0 reporting `[ ok ] Meta Graph API` with
      `configured v26.0  latest v26.0`. That is the gate's real invocation — it runs under
      Node's native type stripping with no build step, verified on Node v24.21.0; there is
      no `tsx` in `node_modules/.bin` and no `npm` script wrapper, so do not reach for one.
      Baseline measured 2026-10-01: exit 0 with
      `[WARN] Meta Graph API … [justification expires 2026-10-27]`.

- [ ] **3. Update the five version keys in `config/lambda-env-manifest.json`.**
      `wecare-partner-onboarding`, `wecare-partner-token-refresh`,
      `wecare-whatsapp-business-api`, `wecare-whatsapp-calling`:
      `META_API_VERSION` → `"v26.0"`. `wecare-marketing-ads`: **leave
      `META_GRAPH_BASE` at `https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0`** and add a `_comment`
      beside it recording that this is a deliberate pin pending the Shop Ads
      `destination_spec` question in §2.6 of this audit — not an oversight. Version keys
      only; touch nothing else in the manifest.
      Files: `config/lambda-env-manifest.json`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -c "import json;json.load(open('config/lambda-env-manifest.json'))"`
      parses, and the new test in item 5 passes.

- [ ] **4. Delete the dead duplicate in `whatsapp_types.py`.**
      Remove lines 3-4, `GRAPH_BASE = 'https://graph.facebook.com'` and
      `DEFAULT_API_VERSION = 'v25.0'`, and replace them with a one-line comment pointing at
      `lambda_utils.meta_version` as the sole authority. **Do not re-export** — §4.2
      explains that a re-export would add `whatsapp_types → meta_version` to the Lambda
      packaging closure that `tests/test_provision_checkout_contract.py:717` pins. Re-confirm
      zero importers first with
      `grep -rn "whatsapp_types\.\(GRAPH_BASE\|DEFAULT_API_VERSION\)\|from .whatsapp_types import" amplify/ tests/ scripts/`;
      if that turns up a caller the audit missed, stop and re-plan rather than breaking it.
      Files: `amplify/functions/shared/lambda_utils/whatsapp_types.py`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_provision_checkout_contract.py -q` passes
      (the packaging closure is unchanged), and
      `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q -k "meta or whatsapp or template"` shows no new
      failures.

- [ ] **5. New test file `tests/test_meta_graph_base_is_validated.py`.**
      Cover what no existing test does: (a) `META_GRAPH_BASE` set to a well-formed base
      resolves `META_API_VERSION` to the embedded version and `GRAPH_BASE` to the given
      URL; (b) each of `https://graph.facebook.com/v26.0.1`,
      `https://graph.facebook.com/v26`, `https://graph.facebook.com`,
      `http://graph.facebook.com/v26.0`, `https://graph.facebook.com/v26.0/`,
      `https://evil.example.com/v26.0`, and `""` raises `MetaVersionError`; (c)
      `META_API_VERSION=v26.0` together with a disagreeing `META_GRAPH_BASE` raises;
      (d) agreeing values do not raise. Use `monkeypatch.setenv` plus
      `importlib.reload`, and assert `pytest.raises(ValueError)` with
      `type(exc).__name__ == "MetaVersionError"` — the existing file documents at
      `tests/test_meta_version.py:64-72` why catching the module's own class across a
      reload does not work. Restore the environment and reload at the end of every test.
      Files: `tests/test_meta_graph_base_is_validated.py`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_meta_graph_base_is_validated.py -q`
      — all pass.

- [ ] **6. New test file `tests/test_meta_version_manifest_agreement.py`.**
      Assert the invariant rather than a count, the way `test_meta_version.py` does:
      (a) every `META_API_VERSION` value in `config/lambda-env-manifest.json` equals
      `lambda_utils.meta_version.META_API_VERSION`; (b) every `META_GRAPH_BASE` value
      parses under the item-1 base regex — so a malformed base cannot be committed even
      though it is allowed to differ; (c) any `META_GRAPH_BASE` whose version differs from
      the default carries a sibling `_comment` explaining the pin, so a deliberate lag is
      distinguishable from a stale one; (d) the only functions carrying either key are the
      five in §4.1, failing with a message naming any newcomer — a new unvalidated version
      route is exactly the defect this audit found. Also add a check that no file under
      `scripts/` hard-codes a Graph version other than the current default, **xfail-marked**
      with a reference to §4.3, so the three known offenders are recorded as debt rather
      than silently tolerated or noisily blocking.
      Files: `tests/test_meta_version_manifest_agreement.py`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_meta_version_manifest_agreement.py -q`
      — all pass, with the scripts check reported as xfail.

- [ ] **7. Run the full suite and record the outcome in this document.**
      Append a short "Implementation outcome" section: the commands run, pass/fail counts,
      and the before/after of every file touched. If `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts` or
      `config/vendor-versions.json` turned out to be owned by another session, say so and
      record the bump as **PARTIAL — `_DEFAULT` not moved, pending vendor-version owner**,
      because `test_python_and_vendor_versions_json_agree` makes the three inseparable. Do
      not paper over a skipped step.
      Files: `docs/execution/meta-graph-version-audit-20261001.md`
      Verify: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` — no regressions against the
      pre-change baseline.

### Explicitly NOT in this change

- **No deploy, no `update-function-code`, no alias move, no push.** The five live env keys
  in §4.1 still read `v25.0`, so production stays on v25.0 until a separately authorized
  deploy. That is deliberate: it decouples the repo-level correction from the runtime flip
  and leaves the live v26.0 round trip as a gate rather than a hope.
- **`marketing-ads/handler.py`** — the Shop Ads `destination_spec` fix (§2.6). Not an owned
  path. Hand off with: set `destination_spec.destination_type` explicitly in
  `_creative_create`, choosing `WEBSITE_AND_SHOP_OPT_OUT` if the WhatsApp destination must
  be preserved; until then the `META_GRAPH_BASE` pin from item 3 keeps that function on
  v25.0.
- **`meta-business-agent/handler.py:230-234`** — the false pin comment. It should be
  corrected to cite this audit, but it is not an owned path. Note that this function
  carries **neither** env key live, so it is the one function a `_DEFAULT` bump actually
  moves.
- **`scripts/meta_webhook_control_plane.py` (v23.0)**, `meta_webhook_audit.py`,
  `check_secrets_live.py` — §4.3.
- **Frontend and IaC literals** — §4.4, including the user-visible
  `src/pages/workspace/dashboard/index.tsx:285` string.
- **`whatsapp-business-api/handler.py:2976`** — strike the non-existent `v27.0` from the
  Block API comment.

## 7. Status summary

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Enumerate every Meta Graph call | ✅ COMPLETE — ~50 endpoints, 18 functions, 3 scripts (§2) |
| Determine the restricted set, doc-cited | ✅ COMPLETE — fresh fetch of the v26.0 changelog and index (§1) |
| Replacement or mitigation per affected call | ✅ COMPLETE — zero affected; one behavioural item with a documented opt-out (§3, §2.6) |
| Owner/provider blockers | ➖ NONE — no call lacks a replacement because no call is restricted |
| Version decision | ✅ **Bump to `v26.0`** (§5) |
| `meta_version.py` validation preserved and extended | ✅ PLANNED — items 1, 5 |
| Duplication reconciled | ✅ PLANNED — item 4; six sources found, not two (§4) |
| Live v26.0 round trip | ⏳ **PENDING — not verified, needs deploy + QA send** |
| `marketing-ads` Shop Ads defaulting | ⏳ PENDING — not an owned path (§2.6) |

**Result: ⚠️ COMPLETE WITH IMPROVEMENTS.** The audit is complete and the bump is
recommended; production does not move until a separately authorized deploy, and the live
v26.0 round trip remains unverified.

---

## 8. Implementation outcome — 2026-10-01

Implemented on branch `stack`. **Not pushed, not deployed, no alias moved, no flag enabled.**

### There are SEVEN sources of truth, not six

The audit counted six. The owner found a seventh and it was the worst of them:

| # | Source | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `lambda_utils/meta_version.py` `_DEFAULT` | `v25.0` | **`v26.0`** |
| 2 | `lambda_utils/whatsapp_types.py` version + host literals | `v25.0`, independent, 0 importers | **deleted** |
| 3 | `META_API_VERSION` env var (4 functions) | `v25.0` live | unchanged — see below |
| 4 | `META_GRAPH_BASE` env var (`wecare-marketing-ads`) | `v25.0`, **never shape-checked** | **validated**, deliberately still `v25.0` |
| 5 | `config/vendor-versions.json` | `v25.0` | **`v26.0`** (regenerated, not hand-edited) |
| 6 | `packages/config/vendorVersions.ts` `META_GRAPH` | `configured: v25.0` + expiring justification | **`v26.0`**, justification removed |
| 7 | **`scripts/meta_webhook_control_plane.py:58`** | **`v23.0` hard-coded — two majors behind** | **`meta_graph_version.graph_base()`** |

Two further script literals were found alongside #7 and fixed the same way:
`scripts/meta_webhook_audit.py:17` and `scripts/check_secrets_live.py:79,89`, both `v25.0`.

`scripts/meta_graph_version.py` is new. Scripts cannot import `lambda_utils` (it lives under
`amplify/functions/shared`, on no script's path), so it resolves from
`config/vendor-versions.json` — the generated mirror a test already ties to the Python module —
and validates the shape on the way out. Reading a repo file is correct for a script and wrong for
a Lambda, which is why the two mechanisms stay separate and a test asserts they agree.

### `META_GRAPH_BASE` is now validated rather than removed

`_resolve()` returns `(version, base)` as one decision. A `META_GRAPH_BASE` must match
`^https://graph\.facebook\.com/v\d{1,3}\.\d$` exactly — anchored both ends, so a trailing slash,
an extra path segment, `http://`, and a host lookalike are all refused. When `META_API_VERSION` and
`META_GRAPH_BASE` disagree it **raises** instead of applying a silent precedence rule, because an
undocumented winner is how §4.1 happened. `base_version()` is exposed so the gate, health endpoints
and tests parse a base the same way.

`GRAPH_BASE` is now the operator's configured value verbatim when set, not re-derived from the
extracted version — otherwise a deliberate pin would be discarded and the two would drift again.

### `wecare-marketing-ads` stays on v25.0, deliberately

Kept exactly as §5 recommended. v26.0 defaults Shop Ads `destination_spec` on `adcreatives`/`ads`,
`marketing-ads` sets none, and WhatsApp-destination creative eligibility is undocumented. It is now
a **validated** override instead of an unchecked URL, which is what makes the pin safe rather than a
hole.

`tests/test_meta_version_sources.py` pins the exception in both directions: it fails if a second
function joins it, and it fails if `marketing-ads` ever reaches the default — the prompt to delete
the carve-out rather than leave a stale one behind.

### Item 3 was NOT done as written, and the reason matters

The plan said to edit the four `META_API_VERSION` values in `config/lambda-env-manifest.json` to
`v26.0`. **That edit was made and then reverted.** The manifest is a *record of live Lambda
environment variables* — its own `_comment` says so, and `scripts/env_manifest.py` diffs it against
live and reports drift. Writing `v26.0` into it would assert something false about production, would
be reverted by the next `--export`, and would make a later correct re-record look like a regression.

The intent is served differently: `test_the_pending_env_deploy_set_is_exactly_what_is_recorded`
enumerates the four functions whose live value trails the repo default and fails when that set
changes in either direction. The remaining work is written down and guarded rather than implied.

**Owner action to complete the bump:** set `META_API_VERSION=v26.0` on `wecare-partner-onboarding`,
`wecare-partner-token-refresh`, `wecare-whatsapp-business-api` and `wecare-whatsapp-calling`; leave
`wecare-marketing-ads`'s `META_GRAPH_BASE` at v25.0; then re-run `scripts/env_manifest.py --export`
and update `PENDING_ENV_DEPLOY`.

### Measured

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q` | **6169 passed, 1 skipped** (baseline before this work: 5964 passed, 1 skipped) |
| `tests/test_meta_version.py` | passed, behaviour unchanged |
| `tests/test_meta_graph_base_is_validated.py` | **new**, 27 passed |
| `tests/test_meta_version_sources.py` | **new**, 12 passed |
| `node scripts/check-versions.ts` | exit 0, `[ ok ] Meta Graph API / WhatsApp Cloud API  configured v26.0  latest v26.0` |
| `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 |

### Still open

| Item | Status | Owner action |
|---|---|---|
| Live v26.0 round trip (OTP template send, payment lookup, `/{catalog-id}/products`) | ⏳ **NOT VERIFIED** — needs a real token, and reading a credential is prohibited here | deploy + a QA send to `+918100640044` |
| The four live `META_API_VERSION` env pins | ⏳ pending deploy, enumerated and test-guarded | set them with the deploy |
| Shop Ads `destination_spec` in `marketing-ads/handler.py` | ⏳ not an owned path | set `destination_spec.destination_type` explicitly, then drop the v25.0 pin |
| `meta-business-agent/handler.py:230-234` false pin comment | ⏳ not an owned path | correct it to cite this audit |
| `whatsapp-business-api/handler.py:2976` references a non-existent `v27.0` | ⏳ not an owned path | strike it |
