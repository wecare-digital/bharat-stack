# Dependabot triage

Companion to `docs/security-codeql-triage.md`, and it exists for the same reason: a
dismissal without a recorded reason is indistinguishable from a dismissal without a thought,
and an alert left open with no note is indistinguishable from one nobody read.

Measured 2026-09-30 against `repos/wecare-digital/wecare-digital/dependabot/alerts?state=open`.

## 55 / 56 / 57 — `brace-expansion`, and why an override does not work

The three alerts are one copy: `node_modules/aws-cdk-lib/node_modules/brace-expansion` at
**5.0.9**, reached through `aws-cdk-lib`'s bundled `minimatch`. The top-level
`node_modules/brace-expansion` is already 5.0.12 and clean.

**An npm `overrides` entry cannot fix this, and the attempt is recorded so nobody repeats
it.** Adding `"brace-expansion@5": "5.0.12"` to `amplify/package.json` and regenerating the
lockfile left the copy at 5.0.9 while churning the lockfile by 1537 lines. The reason is in
the lockfile itself:

```
node_modules/aws-cdk-lib
    bundleDependencies = [..., 'minimatch', ...]
node_modules/aws-cdk-lib/node_modules/brace-expansion
    version  = 5.0.9
    inBundle = True
```

`inBundle: True` means the code ships **inside the `aws-cdk-lib` tarball**. Overrides,
resolutions and manual lockfile edits all describe what npm should *fetch*; none of them
changes the contents of a tarball that has already been fetched. The override was reverted.

**Upgrading does not fix it either.** Both `aws-cdk-lib@2.270.0` (pinned here) and
`2.271.0` (latest at the time of measuring) bundle `brace-expansion@5.0.9` — confirmed by
downloading both tarballs and reading
`package/node_modules/brace-expansion/package.json`. The fix has to come from AWS
republishing `aws-cdk-lib` with a refreshed bundle.

### The `scope=runtime` label is misleading here, and this is the part worth knowing

Dependabot derives scope from `dependencies` versus `devDependencies`. `aws-cdk-lib` sits in
`dependencies` of `amplify/package.json`, so it reports **runtime**. It reaches no deployed
artifact:

- **Every Lambda function is `python3.12`** (65 zip-packaged plus one container). Measured
  via `list-functions --query 'Functions[].Runtime'`. A Node package cannot be inside a
  Python function zip, and `deploy_all_lambdas.py` bundles no third-party packages at all.
- **The Amplify build never installs it.** `amplify.yml` runs `npm ci` against the **root**
  lockfile, and `amplify/package.json` is deliberately a separate install root whose
  packages the root lockfile does not contain — see `docs/npm-ci-backend-isolation.md`.

So the copy exists only when a developer runs `npm install` inside `amplify/` to use
`ampx sandbox` or `ampx pipeline-deploy`. The advisories are ReDoS in a glob brace expander;
reaching it needs attacker-controlled glob patterns, and at CDK synth time the patterns come
from our own asset-bundling code.

**Do not dismiss these as "not used".** They are genuinely present in a manifest and will
become fixable the moment AWS refreshes the bundle. Leave them open so the fix is noticed;
this file is the reason they are open.

## 23 — `uuid`, and what the earlier fix actually achieved

GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq affects `uuid` before 11.1.1 when a caller supplies its own output
buffer. The vulnerable copy is `node_modules/xcode/node_modules/uuid@7.0.3`, pulled in by
`@capacitor/cli` → `xcode`.

Two things were established and both still hold:

1. **Not reachable from our code.** Nothing under `src/` or `amplify/` imports `uuid` at
   all — zero hits. The separate top-level `node_modules/uuid` is already 11.1.1.
2. **Now correctly scoped.** `@capacitor/cli` was moved to `devDependencies`, and the
   lockfile confirms the effect: `node_modules/xcode/node_modules/uuid` is `dev=True`, so
   the alert reports `scope=development` rather than runtime.

It cannot be resolved by upgrading, because `xcode` requires `uuid@^7`, and native packaging
is **POST-PROJECT** per `.kiro/steering/00-current-owner-overrides.md` — so the tool that
drags it in is not used in the current phase either.

**Remaining action is a dismissal, which is owner-gated.** Dismissing a security alert is an
account-level security decision, so it is not taken under standing authorization. The
dismissal reason to select is *"vulnerable code is not actually used"*, and the two points
above are its evidence.

## 58 / 59 — `oauthlib`, fixed

Both advisories had to be read together to find the fix. GHSA-hj66-6f7g-4r5v covers
`<= 3.3.1` and GHSA-xpv3-w29h-x7cv covers `>= 3.0.0, < 4.0.0` — so **every 3.x release is
affected** and only the 4.x line clears both. A patch bump would have closed one alert and
left the other, which is the trap in treating two alerts on one package as one problem.

`requests-oauthlib` declares `oauthlib >= 3.0.0` with no upper bound, so 4.0.0 is within the
declared range rather than forced past it. Verified in a throwaway venv before changing the
pin: `oauthlib 4.0.0` + `requests-oauthlib 2.0.0` + `google-auth-oauthlib 1.4.1` all import,
and `OAuth2Session.authorization_url` still round-trips. 5201 pytest pass after the bump.

Worth noting for whoever revisits this: **nothing in this repository imports `oauthlib` or
`google_auth_oauthlib`.** They are transitive dev dependencies. Removing them outright would
also have closed both alerts and was deliberately not done — the Google API work in
`scripts/` uses service-account impersonation through `google-auth`, and pulling packages a
concurrent session might reach for is a worse trade than a version bump that costs nothing.

## Reproducing

```
gh api "repos/wecare-digital/wecare-digital/dependabot/alerts?state=open&per_page=20" \
  --jq '.[] | "\(.number)  \(.security_advisory.severity)  \(.dependency.package.name)@\(.security_vulnerability.vulnerable_version_range)  scope=\(.dependency.scope)  \(.dependency.manifest_path)"'
```

To check what a bundled dependency really contains, read the tarball rather than the
lockfile — the lockfile records what was requested, the tarball records what shipped:

```
curl -sSL -o cdk.tgz "$(npm view aws-cdk-lib@2.271.0 dist.tarball)"
tar -xzOf cdk.tgz 'package/node_modules/brace-expansion/package.json'
```
