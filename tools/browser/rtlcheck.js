/**
 * rtlcheck - does the site survive being mirrored, and does it declare its direction.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE GATE. Every other harness here loads a page in its shipped
 * direction, which is left-to-right on all 761 routes. The catalogue served to visitors
 * includes Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Urdu, Pashto and Sindhi, so right-to-left is a state
 * a real reader reaches by pressing one button - and it was a state no suite entered.
 * pageaudit and devicecheck both pass at every width while the footer renders its full
 * stops at the wrong end of the line.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, per route:
 *   1. The served HTML DECLARES dir. An undeclared direction is decided by the user agent,
 *      which is the same class of defect as an undeclared color-scheme.
 *   2. Under dir=rtl there is no horizontal overflow. This is the measurement that catches
 *      a physical margin, padding or inset that did not become logical: a left-anchored
 *      absolute box in a mirrored document pushes the page wider than the viewport.
 *   3. Under dir=rtl the fixed chrome stays on screen - the header bar spans the viewport
 *      and the language widget is fully inside it. The widget was pinned with right:20px,
 *      which in Arabic left it on the side a reader's eye ENDS on, over the text.
 *   4. The body's computed direction actually changes. A guard on the mechanism itself:
 *      if setting the attribute stopped taking effect, every other assertion here would
 *      still pass while proving nothing.
 *
 * HOW RTL IS ENTERED, AND WHY BOTH ATTRIBUTES ARE SET. This sets `lang` AND `dir` together,
 * which is what SupportWidget does in production. Setting only `dir` tests a state no
 * visitor can reach, and the first version of this gate did exactly that - it reported the
 * language widget pinned to the right under rtl and blamed the CSS.
 *
 * THE REASON IS NOT OBVIOUS AND IS WORTH STATING. The build does not ship the logical
 * properties this code is written with. Lightning CSS, which Next uses to minify, downlevels
 * `inset-inline-end:20px` for the configured browser targets into a PAIR OF :lang() RULES:
 *
 *   .wc-langbar:not(:is(:lang(ar),:lang(he), ... )){left:auto;right:20px}
 *   .wc-langbar:is(:lang(ar),:lang(he), ... )){left:20px;right:auto}
 *
 * `inset-inline` appears ZERO times in out/. So in the shipped stylesheet, mirroring is
 * keyed on the LANGUAGE attribute, not on `dir` - and `dir="rtl"` alone flips the bidi
 * algorithm while leaving every box physically where it was. The two attributes are not
 * independent here, and anything that sets one without the other gets half a mirror.
 *

  /**
   * MIRROR SYMMETRY, which is the measurement that answers "is it actually mirrored" rather
   * than only "does it overflow". For a correctly mirrored element, its distance from the
   * inline-START edge is the same in both directions: left in ltr equals (viewport - right)
   * in rtl. A physical padding-left, margin-left or border-left that was never made logical
   * shows up as a difference, and nothing else does.
   *
   * THREE CLASSES ARE EXCLUDED, each for a real reason rather than to flatter the number.
   *   - EVERY INLINE-LEVEL BOX, including inline-block and inline-flex. A mirrored paragraph
   *     reflows, and an inline-level box is placed by line layout rather than against its
   *     container's edge, so it legitimately lands somewhere else - measuring it reports the
   *     bidi algorithm working as a fault. inline-block and inline-flex were allowed through
   *     at first, on the theory that a "box" should hold its place; the rotating hero pill and
   *     the brand badge then reported 79-555px of asymmetry for reflowing exactly as they
   *     should. Only block, flex and grid containers have a position defined relative to their
   *     container, which is what this assertion is about.
   *   - Subtrees under an explicit dir attribute. A terminal panel or a code sample is
   *     left-to-right by SYNTAX and is locked with dir="ltr" on purpose; it is supposed to be
   *     asymmetric, and a gate that failed on it would be arguing with the fix.
   *   - Class names that appear MORE THAN ONCE on the page. A mirrored flex row reverses its
   *     children, which is correct mirroring and moves every item's offset - so a row of
   *     cards reports a large difference for doing exactly the right thing. Restricting the
   *     assertion to singletons keeps it on page landmarks, where reordering is not a factor.
   *
   * OFFSETS ARE MEASURED AGAINST document.body, NOT THE VIEWPORT. The vertical scrollbar
   * changes side under rtl, which shifts every viewport-relative coordinate by its width and
   * reported a uniform ~16px asymmetry on every element of every page. Normalising against
   * the body box cancels it, because the scrollbar moves the body too.
