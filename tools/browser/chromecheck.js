/**
 * chromecheck - header, footer and support widget on EVERY page that ships.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP. Those three are mounted once in src/pages/_app.tsx, and a page
 * receives them by being on the isPublic allowlist and by no other means. Three separate
 * failures have already come from that single fact, and none of them were visible in the
 * source:
 *
 *  - A page can be exported and reachable while sitting on NO router this file knows about.
 *    src/app/settings/internal-agent/page.tsx lived in an App Router directory, so it never
 *    reached _app.tsx: no Cognito wrapper, no chrome, and no stylesheet. It was served at
 *    HTTP 200 to anyone.
 *  - The existence of that app/ directory ALSO handed not-found handling to the App Router,
 *    so src/pages/404.tsx was ignored and every mistyped URL got Next's built-in shell -
 *    6.8KB, no header, no footer, no widget, and zero links out. The site's own 404 was a
 *    dead end, and nothing in the source said so.
 *  - /contact-test was on the allowlist AND wrapped itself in the authenticated Layout, so
 *    it prerendered the entire staff sidebar into public HTML.
 *
 * WHY IT READS THE BUILT EXPORT rather than the route table. Every one of the above is a
 * discrepancy between what the source implies and what the build emits. A test that reads
 * _app.tsx can only confirm the source agrees with itself. This opens out/ and asks each
 * file what it actually contains, which is the only question a visitor's browser asks.
 *
 * UNIT TESTS COVER THE INTENT, THIS COVERS THE ARTEFACT. src/test/PublicRouteRegistration.
 * test.ts asserts the allowlist and the page files agree; this asserts the HTML on disk has
 * the markup. Both are needed - the first catches a forgotten registration in a second, the
 * second catches a whole router nobody remembered.
