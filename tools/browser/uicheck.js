/**
 * uicheck - the header lockup, and the floating support pill.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN. This harness used to measure TWO
 * floating widgets: `.wc-langbar` from this repo, and `#wecarewa-widget`, injected by
 * wecare-wa-widget.js from app.wecare.digital at `z-index: 2147483647` - the maximum
 * 32-bit integer, so nothing could ever be stacked above it. Every assertion here was
 * shaped by that constraint: it stubbed the external button when the script did not
 * load, checked the two circles were the same size and shared a centre line, measured
 * the gap between them, and proved the language panel could not be punched through by
 * a circle it was forbidden from covering.
 *
 * That script is retired. WhatsApp is now the left half of a single pill this repo owns
 * (src/components/SupportWidget.tsx), so all of the above is either meaningless or
 * unmeasurable: there is no second widget to align to, no gap, and no panel - the
 * language control is a native <select>, so the platform owns its popup and the page
 * cannot measure it. Keeping those assertions is what turned this file red.
 *
 * WHAT ONLY RENDERED GEOMETRY CAN STILL ANSWER.
 *
 * 1. THE BRAND LOCKUP. The logo is an <img> with a fixed height; the wordmark beside it
 *    is two lines whose height is font-size x line-height x 2. Two unrelated formulas,
 *    so they agree only by coincidence. The delta is REPORTED, not asserted - the logo
 *    being slightly taller than the wordmark is normal lockup practice and is currently
 *    a deliberate choice. What IS asserted is that the wordmark is optically centred
 *    against the logo, because an off-centre lockup is a defect under any sizing.
 *
 * 2. THE TWO CONTROLS INSIDE THE PILL. `.wc-wa` is a 40px circle; `.wc-chip` is a text
 *    chip whose height comes from font metrics and padding. Those are different
 *    formulas again, so "do they sit on one centre line inside the pill" cannot be read
 *    off the stylesheet - and a chip half a pixel low is visible at this size.
 *
 * 3. IS THE PILL ACTUALLY CLICKABLE. The retired external button won its stacking war
 *    by brute force. This one is a normal element at `z-index: 1300`, which has to clear
 *    the phone BottomNav (`z-index: 1200`, Layout.css) and the header menu (1002). Those
 *    numbers live in three files that cannot see each other, so the check here is not a
 *    number comparison but a hit test: `elementFromPoint` at the centre of each control
 *    must land inside that control. If anything is painted over the pill, that fails -
 *    whatever the reason, and regardless of which stylesheet caused it.
 *
 * 4. THE TRANSLATING STATE STAYS LIGHT. The busy signal was a dark #1a3a2a inversion of
 *    the chip and is now a lime pulse ring plus a lime sweep along the pill's bottom
 *    edge. "Not dark" is asserted on the COMPUTED background, because the requirement is
 *    about what renders, and a styled-jsx rule can be overridden by a later cascade
 *    without anyone editing SupportWidget.tsx. The pill's width is measured mid-flight
 *    too: the sweep is absolutely positioned precisely so a translation cannot resize
 *    the widget, and a regression there would make the corner of every page twitch.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE HOME PAGE. Only the lockup differs there (`homeBrand`); the pill is
 * identical, and /contact/ additionally carries the header variant most pages use. This
 * runs against /contact/ for continuity with the measurements this file has always taken.
 *
 * THE LANGUAGE API IS STUBBED. SupportWidget fetches api.wecare.digital, which sends no
 * Access-Control-Allow-Origin for 127.0.0.1, so against a local origin the fetch fails
 * and the language chip never appears. Note what that does NOT do any more: the widget
 * no longer returns null when the catalogue fails, so the WhatsApp half still renders.
 * The chip's absence is therefore a real failure rather than an ambiguous one, and it is
 * reported as such - an earlier revision of this file quietly skipped the assertion in
 * that case, which is the kind of silent pass this suite exists to prevent.

/**
 * ONE SCROLL CONTAINER, AND A FOOTER THAT LANDS FLUSH.
 *
 * Layout.css used to put `height: 100%` and `overflow-y: auto` on html AND body, which made
 * two nested scrollers: the page scrolled inside body while html kept a separate leftover
 * range stacked on top, containing nothing. Scroll to the end and you travelled through
 * body's range and then through html's, and html's range was empty space - 196px of blank
 * white below the footer on a 390px phone, 623px on a 320px one with the footer pushed off
 * the top of the screen entirely.
 *
 * WHY THIS BELONGS IN A BROWSER HARNESS AND NOT ONLY IN A UNIT TEST. ScrollContainer.test.ts
 * pins the declarations, which catches the edit. It cannot catch the effect: the bug is a
 * product of viewport height against content height against a computed overflow value, and
 * the reason it survived review is that at 1440x900 html's leftover range happens to
 * compute to 0 - the widths people develop at were the widths it worked on. Only a real
 * layout at a real phone size answers it, so this asserts at every viewport in the matrix.
