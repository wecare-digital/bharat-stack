/**
 * Chromium resolution for the browser harness.
 *
 * NEVER HARDCODE THE REVISION. This sandbox ships Chromium under
 * /opt/playwright/chromium-<rev>/, not the ~/.cache/ms-playwright path Playwright
 * looks in by default, AND THE REVISION CHANGES ACROSS SANDBOX RESETS. Harnesses
 * pinned to `chromium-1243` all died with "executable doesn't exist" on a box that
 * had `chromium-1232` sitting right there. That failure reads like a broken harness
 * rather than a relocated browser, and it cost a full debugging round - which is the
 * entire reason this file exists instead of a string literal at each call site.
 *
 * We depend on playwright-core, not playwright, on purpose: playwright-core never
 * tries to download a browser. It drives whatever binary it is handed via
 * executablePath, which is exactly the arrangement we want when the binary is
 * already on disk and its revision is not ours to choose.
 *
 * THIS FILE USED TO BE LINUX-ONLY, AND THAT COST A DEBUGGING ROUND OF ITS OWN -
 * the same kind the revision scan above exists to prevent, one platform out. It
 * searched /opt/playwright, ~/.cache/ms-playwright and four /usr/bin paths, so on
 * macOS every harness in this directory threw "No Chromium executable found" on a
 * machine with Google Chrome sitting in /Applications. Nothing was broken: the
 * cache is ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright on macOS, not ~/.cache, and a Mac browser
 * is an .app bundle rather than a file on PATH. Neither is an unusual setup, which
 * is precisely why hardcoding one platform's shape reads as a harness bug.
 *
 * Resolution order, first hit wins:
 *   1. CHROME env var             - explicit override, always respected
 *   2. PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH   - respected when Playwright's own cache is moved
 *   3. /opt/playwright            - the Linux sandbox, highest chromium-* revision
 *   4. Playwright's per-OS cache  - ~/.cache (Linux) or ~/Library/Caches (macOS)
 *   5. system chrome/chromium     - a developer laptop, Linux paths or .app bundles
 *
 * On total failure it THROWS naming every path it searched. It must never return
 * undefined: launch() would then report a misleading "executable doesn't exist" for
 * a path nobody chose, which is the confusing failure this module is built to avoid.

/**
 * Where a chromium-<rev> directory keeps its binary. Taken from playwright-core's own
 * EXECUTABLE_PATHS table (lib/coreBundle.js, v1.63) rather than from memory, because the
 * names have churned: the mac directories are chrome-mac-x64 / chrome-mac-arm64 and NOT
 * the chrome-mac that older guides and older Playwright releases describe.
 *
 * Every platform's paths are listed unconditionally and simply miss on the wrong OS. That
 * is deliberate - a process.platform switch here would be one more thing to get wrong on
 * the next host, and a miss costs one statSync.
 *
 * ORDER IS SIGNIFICANT. Full-chrome layouts come first and headless-shell layouts last,
 * for the reason the original file gave: a headless shell cannot report layout for
 * anything that needs a real compositor, so it is a fallback rather than an equal.

 * had already passed on the same runner. networkidle resolves only after 500ms with no

 * it is flakiest on the harness that navigates most: typecheck visits 15 routes at 2 widths,
 * so it gets 30 chances to hit it where animcheck gets 4.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS for these measurements is that web fonts have loaded. Text width,
 * line count and reflow all change when a fallback face is swapped for Inter, and that is
 * the one late-arriving resource that can alter a number. document.fonts.ready is the
 * direct signal for it, so this waits on the real dependency instead of on a correlate.
 *
 * The short settle after it absorbs the layout pass that a font swap triggers. Verified to
 * produce byte-identical output to the networkidle version of typecheck.js locally.
