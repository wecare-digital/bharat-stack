/**
 * navcheck - the workspace navigation against the routes the build actually emits.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM routegraph.js. routegraph reads hrefs out of the rendered
 * HTML, and every /workspace/ page ships ZERO /workspace/ hrefs: the shell is rendered on
 * the client behind an auth gate, so the sidebar exists in no static document. Measured on
 * out/workspace/engage/index.html - 0 matches for href="/workspace. routegraph therefore
 * reports all 105 workspace routes as orphans, which is true of the crawlable graph and
 * says nothing about whether an operator can reach them.
 *
 * So the workspace's real reachability question is a SOURCE question - is the route in
 * src/config/navigation.ts - and that is what this checks. The two scripts together cover
 * the site: routegraph owns the public graph, navcheck owns the authenticated one.
 *
 * WHY THE PATHS ARE REGEX-EXTRACTED rather than imported. navigation.ts is TypeScript and
 * the app is type:module; importing it needs a transpile step, and a transpile in an audit
 * script is a dependency that can break independently of the thing being audited. Every
 * path in that file is written as a `path: '...'` literal - 113 of them - so a regex sees
 * all of them, including any a hand-maintained list would drift from.
 *
 * QUERY STRINGS ARE FILTERS, NOT ROUTES. '/workspace/engage/inbox?channel=rcs' is the inbox
 * with a selector pre-set; it resolves to the inbox page. Stripped before comparison, and
 * counted separately so the report does not claim five missing pages that are one page.
 *
 * Run: node tools/audit/navcheck.js        (needs out/ - npm run build)

/*
 * ABSENT FROM navigation.ts IS NOT THE SAME AS UNREACHABLE, and the first version of
 * this script conflated them. It reported ten absences; seven of them an operator can
 * open today, because this app reaches pages two ways the sidebar never mentions:
 *
 *   1. A HUB EMBEDS THEM AS TABS. /workspace/engage/service-ops imports '../orders' and
 *      renders it as its default tab, so "Orders" is the orders page even though only
 *      the hub has a nav row. Same for rcs/send, rcs/templates and whatsapp/inbox. The
 *      import is RELATIVE, so grepping for the route string finds nothing - which is
 *      exactly how the earlier pass talked itself into "wire up 3 pages" and nearly
 *      added duplicate sidebar rows for screens that were already on screen.
 *   2. A PAGE LINKS THEM BY STRING. /workspace/index.tsx is a tile grid, and its
 *      Settings tile is the only route to settings/internal-agent.
 *
 * So resolve both kinds of edge and walk the graph from the nav rows. What survives the
 * walk is unreachable for real, and that number is the only one worth acting on.
