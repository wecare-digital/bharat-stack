/**
 * branchstate - is it safe to push to this branch, and is anything actually unmerged?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three times in one session (#82, #83, #88) work was pushed to a branch whose
 * pull request had ALREADY been squash-merged. Every push succeeded, every push was a no-op, and
 * the owner reported "I cannot see the change" each time.
 *
 * THE TRAP IS SQUASH-MERGE PLUS `git log`. A squash merge replays the branch as ONE NEW COMMIT with
 * a new SHA, so the original commits are not ancestors of the default branch. `git log stack..HEAD`
 * therefore lists them as unmerged - truthfully, by SHA - while their content is already in. Every
 * time, the answer looked like "four commits still to land" when the real answer was "one".
 *
 * SO THIS CHECKS CONTENT, NOT COMMITS. `git diff stack...HEAD` is the question that matters: does
 * this branch change anything relative to the default branch? If the diff is empty, there is
 * nothing to push no matter what the log says. Reporting both side by side is deliberate - seeing
 * "7 commits ahead, 0 files differing" is what makes the trap obvious.
 *
 * AND IT ASKS GITHUB WHETHER THE PR IS CLOSED. The other half of the failure: a merged PR's branch
 * must not be reused, because a push to it neither reopens the PR nor reaches the default branch.
 * gh is optional here - without it the content check still works, which matters because the content
 * check is the load-bearing one.
 *
 * Run: node tools/audit/branchstate.js
 * Exit 1 when pushing would be pointless or wrong, so it can gate a pre-push hook.
