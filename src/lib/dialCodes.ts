/**
 * Country dial codes, in one place.
 *
 * MOVED HERE RATHER THAN COPIED. This list already existed as a `COUNTRY_CODES` literal inside
 * src/pages/workspace/contacts/index.tsx, which is a workspace page a shopper never sees. The
 * public sign-in field needs the same entries, and a second literal would have been two lists to
 * keep in step - the kind of duplication that ends with the workspace offering a code the
 * storefront refuses. The contacts page imports from here.
 *
 * ORDER IS DELIBERATE AND NOT ALPHABETICAL. India is first because it is the store's market; the
 * rest follow broadly by how likely they are for this audience (Gulf and SE Asia before Europe,
 * because that is where the diaspora this store serves actually is). A select whose first option
 * is the common answer is faster than one that opens on Argentina.
 *
 * ── NO FLAGS, BY OWNER INSTRUCTION (2026-10-02) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An emoji flag was briefly carried per row and has been REMOVED. It also removes a real rendering
 * problem rather than only a preference: Windows ships no flag glyphs, so Chrome and Edge there
 * rendered each regional-indicator pair as two bare letters ("IN") instead of a flag, which looked
 * broken on a large share of desktop visits. The dial code and the country name carry all the
 * information the flag did. Do not reintroduce emoji flags; if flags are ever wanted again they
 * need an SVG sprite and a decision about its weight on a static export.
 *
 * ── WHICH TERRITORIES ARE OFFERED, AND WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two separate reasons remove a territory from this list, and they should not be conflated:
 *
 * 1. TECHNICAL - WhatsApp cannot deliver there, so an OTP could never arrive. Offering such a code
 *    is a dead end the person cannot see, the same class of defect as the "no files are registered
 *    to this number" guard on /get. Excluded on this ground:
 *      +86  China        - WhatsApp blocked since 2017 (was previously offered here; removed)
 *      +98  Iran         - WhatsApp blocked
 *      +963 Syria        - WhatsApp blocked / unavailable
 *      +850 North Korea  - no consumer internet access
 *
 * 2. COMMERCIAL / REGULATORY - the owner has decided the business does not serve that market.
 *    This is an ordinary market-scope decision of the kind every business makes, and it is the
 *    owner's call, not this file's. Excluded on this ground:
 *      +92  Pakistan     - owner instruction, 2026-10-02
 *
 * HOW TO RECORD A FUTURE EXCLUSION: add the dial code, the country, the date, and WHICH of the two
 * reasons above applies. Keep the reason factual - a market-scope or compliance decision, stated as
 * such. This file is read by engineers, auditors and anyone reviewing the repo, so the comment
 * should say what was decided and when, not characterise the people who live there.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT ON COMPLETENESS. WhatsApp is available in most of the world, so an exhaustive list
 * runs to ~195 entries. This is a CURATED SUBSET of the markets this store plausibly serves, not a
 * claim to completeness, and it is deliberately easy to extend: add a row with its name, code and
 * nationalDigits. It is NOT generated from a vendor feed - no vendor publishes a machine-readable
 * "supported countries" list - so anyone extending it should check the territory is not blocked
 * before adding it.
 *
 * NOT THE VALIDATION AUTHORITY. `nationalDigits` is a CLIENT-SIDE pre-check so a shopper learns
 * about a wrong-length number before a round trip. The server remains the authority:
 * customerAuth.normaliseMobile() and the Python validators have to agree with the backend byte for
 * byte, and neither is relaxed by anything here.
