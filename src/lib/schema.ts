/**
 * The site's schema.org entity graph, defined ONCE.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, one company was described three different ways:
 * `_app.tsx` defined a full `Organization` with `@id .../#organization`, while
 * `post/[slug].tsx` and `BlogIndexHead.tsx` each inlined a thinner, ANONYMOUS copy as
 * `publisher` — name and url, no `@id`, no logo. Both were right to inline rather than
 * reference, and that is the part worth understanding: `_app.tsx` renders its whole `<Head>`
 * behind `!isContentPublic`, so on `/blog/*` and `/post/*` the `#organization` node does not
 * exist, and `publisher: { '@id': '…#organization' }` there would have been a reference that
 * resolves to nothing — worse than a duplicate.
 *
 * The fix is not to reference a suppressed node. It is to stop the node being suppressed:
 * every public surface now emits `ORGANIZATION` and `WEBSITE` from this module, so the
 * `@id`s are defined on all ~1,350 indexable URLs and references to them resolve everywhere.
 *
 * SCALE OF WHAT THAT CHANGES. The blog is 1,279 posts plus ~54 index pages against 20
 * marketing routes, so before this the company entity was absent from roughly 98% of the
 * indexable site. Entity consolidation is the whole point of `@id`: Google reconciles nodes
 * that share one, and three anonymous publishers named "WECARE.DIGITAL" are three blank
 * nodes rather than one company.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
 * -----------------------------
 * No `aggregateRating`, no `review`, no `offers`, no `foundingDate`. Each was removed from
 * this graph for a stated reason and none of them has become true since — `_app.tsx`'s
 * comments record the detail, and the short version is that a fabricated rating is grounds
 * for a manual action against the whole domain, and a wrong founding date is a checkable
 * false claim. A validator cannot catch either: invented markup is syntactically perfect.
 *
 * Every value below is sourced from something already published on this site or measured in
 * this repository. Nothing is inferred.
