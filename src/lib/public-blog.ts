/**
 * WHAT A BLOG CARD ACTUALLY NEEDS - seven fields of the eighteen the API returns.
 *
 * THIS TYPE IS THE FIX FOR AN 842 kB PAGE. /blog/ shipped every field of all 834 posts
 * into __NEXT_DATA__ and rendered seven of them. Measured against the live endpoint,
 * the response is 874 kB and breaks down like this:
 *
 *   excerpt 180k  metaDescription 122k  url 61k  seoTitle 52k  slug 37k  title 35k
 *   robots 33k  id 32k  tags 25k  modifiedDate 22k  publishedDate 21k  authorName 20k
 *   category 12k  + focusKeyword/keywords/jsonLd/coverImage/hashtags ~7k
 *
 * metaDescription, seoTitle, robots, tags, modifiedDate, url and id are 357 kB that no
 * card renders - metaDescription and seoTitle exist for the POST page's <head>, and it
 * fetches its own post. `id` goes too: it was only ever the React key, and slug is
 * unique and already present.
 *
 * Kept deliberately: excerpt is the single largest field and it stays, because the card
 * prints it and search matches on it. coverImage is kept although the card does not use
 * it today - it is 1.7 kB across all 834 posts, which is the cost of one small image, and
 * leaving it out would make adding card art a data change rather than a markup one.
 *
 * `tags` CAME BACK, and it is the one field here that is carried for SEARCH rather than for
 * rendering. It was dropped as part of the 357 kB because no card prints it, which was true and
 * is still true - nothing renders it. What that reasoning missed is that search matches on more
 * than what is visible: every post in the corpus carries tags, and they hold the words a reader
 * actually types. "Beverages", "Herbal Tea", "Chai", "Lemongrass" are tags on posts whose titles
 * and excerpts contain none of those strings, so searching any of them returned nothing at all.
 *
 * The cost is small and it is paid by the right people. Measured against the live endpoint over
 * 1064 posts, adding tags takes the search index from 350.0 kB to 391.4 kB - and that index is
 * fetched lazily, only once a reader types, so a visitor who never searches downloads none of it.
 * In a page's own props it is roughly 1 kB across 24 cards.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------- *
 * A FAILED REQUEST MUST NOT BECOME A MISSING PAGE.
 *
 * This is the mechanism that shipped 219 dead links to the live site, and it is worth
 * spelling out because every individual piece of it looked reasonable.
 *
 * `fetchPost` returned `null` for BOTH "no such post" and "the request failed".
 * `getStaticProps` in /post/[slug] turns `null` into `notFound: true`. Under
 * `output: 'export'` a `notFound` page is simply NOT EMITTED - no error, no warning.
 * Meanwhile the LIST call had succeeded, so the index pages still rendered a card and a
 * link for every one of those posts.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-09-29 build: the list returned 1089 posts, 870 post pages were
 * emitted, and the index pages linked all 1089. 219 of those links went to pages that do
 * not exist. The comment above this block already recorded that 117 of the per-slug
 * requests came back 429 in a 24-hour window, so the throttling was known - what was
 * missing was any consequence for it.
 *
 * Three changes, each addressing a different term:
 *
 *   1. 404 is distinguished from failure. Only a 404 means "no such post".
 *   2. A retryable status or a network error is RETRIED with backoff and jitter, which is
 *      what actually recovers a 429 rather than converting it into a hole.
 *   3. When the retries are exhausted the fetch THROWS, failing the build. A build that
 *      dies loudly is strictly better than one that publishes 219 dead links, and this is
 *      the deliberate opposite of the "stale beats empty" choice in the Lambda's own cache
 *      - there, the fallback is complete-but-slightly-old data; here, the fallback was an
 *      incomplete site.
 *
 * The bounded concurrency below addresses the cause rather than the symptom: 1089 per-slug
 * fetches issued as fast as nine Next workers can dispatch them is what produced the 429s
 * in the first place.

/**
 * PER-SLUG BUILD-TIME MEMO. The same mechanism as postsPromise above, and it was missing

 *
 * MEASURED, not guessed. API Gateway access logs for 24h on 2026-09-28:
 *
 *     185,576 requests to /seo-tools/blog-public*, all userAgent "node"
 *     890 distinct paths - exactly the 889 slugs plus the list endpoint
 *     each slug hit ~219 times, against 54 Amplify builds in the same window
 *
 * 219 / 54 is about 4 fetches of every slug per build. 117 of those requests came back
 * 429, so it was consuming API Gateway stage capacity from every other route on the API.
 *
 * WHY FOUR AND NOT ONE. Next renders with 9 workers and more than one page type resolves a
 * post: /post/[slug] via getStaticProps, and the blog index, its 35 paginated pages and the
 * per-category streams all sit on the same corpus. Without a memo each of those paths is an
 * independent fetch of the same document, and the module-level memo on the LIST call is
 * exactly why the list was not also multiplied.
 *
 * THE PER-SLUG FETCH ITSELF IS NECESSARY and must not be replaced by a filter over
 * listPublicBlogPosts(): the single-post response carries `content` and `richContent`, which
 * the list response omits. Checked against the live API rather than assumed. So the fix is
 * to fetch each slug once, not to stop fetching.
 *
 * NULL NOW MEANS ONE THING ONLY: a 404. It used to mean "no such post" OR "the request
 * failed", and conflating those is what put 219 dead links on the live site - see the long
 * note above `RETRYABLE_STATUS`. A failed request throws now, so a caller that receives
 * null can safely treat the post as genuinely absent.
 *
 * Caching the promise rather than the value also means concurrent callers share one
 * in-flight request instead of each starting their own, which is the normal case here
 * because Next renders pages in parallel. A rejection is evicted so a later caller retries.
