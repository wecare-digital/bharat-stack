/**
 * Shared shape for the long legal documents in this directory.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: terms.ts and privacy.ts each declared their own identical copy
 * of this interface, and LegalDocument imported the one from terms.ts. The two copies
 * then drifted - `inShort` was added to the privacy copy only, so the component could
 * not read the field it was being passed and the summaries silently rendered as
 * nothing. Structural typing hid it: the extra optional property still satisfied the
 * older interface, so the build stayed green. One declaration, imported by all three.
