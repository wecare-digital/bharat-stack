/**
 * Privacy Policy — rewritten in plain English.
 *
 * THIS REPO IS NOW THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. The text originally came from the old Wix site,
 * which is being retired, so there is no longer an upstream to sync with and no
 * extractor to re-run. Edit this file.
 *
 * WHAT THE REWRITE CHANGED, on owner instruction:
 *   - Active voice and short sentences. The original averaged 34 words a sentence and
 *     was almost entirely passive ("Personal Data may be processed to..."), which reads
 *     as evasive even where the underlying commitment is fine.
 *   - Removed circular hedging. "We will use an appropriate mechanism where applicable
 *     law requires an appropriate mechanism" says nothing; where a commitment is
 *     unconditional it is now stated as one.
 *   - Cut repetition. The contact block appeared three times and the
 *     verify-identity-before-acting caveat four; each now appears once.
 *   - Added `inShort` to every section. Legal prose is read by people deciding whether
 *     to trust you, and 24 sections of clauses with no summary is not readable on a
 *     phone.
 *
 * WHAT IT DID NOT CHANGE: any obligation, right, retention basis, lawful basis, or
 * limitation. Every section keeps its original NUMBER and scope, so cross-references
 * from elsewhere on the site still resolve. Nothing was added that makes a factual claim
 * about data handling that the original did not already make - in particular the
 * original's deliberate vagueness about WHICH data each service collects is preserved,
 * because that varies by service and inventing specifics would be a false statement.
 *
 * STILL NEEDS A LAWYER for two things I could not resolve by editing: the DPDP Act 2023
 * requires a named Data Protection Officer or equivalent contact, and consent notices
 * should be itemised per purpose. Both need a decision from the business and its counsel.
 *
 * THAT NOTE BELONGS HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. It was briefly written into section 23 as a
 * rendered paragraph beginning "PENDING LEGAL REVIEW", which published an internal
 * engineering to-do inside the policy itself - telling every reader, and any regulator who
 * opened the page, that the document was known to be incomplete. Open questions about a
 * legal document go in this comment, which ships in the repo and not on the page.
