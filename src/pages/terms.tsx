/**
 * /terms — Terms of Service.
 *
 * ROUTING: '/terms' must be in the EXACT-MATCH allowlist in _app.tsx or this renders an
 * empty body with HTTP 200. trailingSlash means the URL is /terms/.
 *
 * THE REAL DOCUMENT, all 45 sections plus the 12 sub-clauses of section 14. The text
 * originally came from the old Wix site; it has since been rewritten into plain English
 * on the owner's instruction, and THIS REPO IS NOW THE SOURCE OF TRUTH - there is no
 * upstream page to sync with. src/content/legal/terms.ts records exactly what the
 * rewrite changed and, more importantly, what it did not.
 *
 * noindex was removed with the placeholder. It existed because an indexed empty legal
 * page is the document a regulator or a payment provider gets pointed at; that reasoning
 * does not apply to a complete one, and terms of service should be findable.
 *
 * THE NOTICE SAYS THIS IS THE AGREEMENT, deliberately. It previously read "these Terms
 * are a summary of the agreement in force and are provided for information", which is
 * exactly backwards - it described the operative contract as a non-binding summary of
 * some other document that does not exist. Telling readers that the terms they are
 * agreeing to are merely informational is not a cautious disclaimer, it is an argument
 * against your own enforceability. The genuinely useful caveat, that this is not legal
 * advice about their particular situation, is kept.
