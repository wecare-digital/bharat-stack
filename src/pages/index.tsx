/**
 * Home — the company page.
 *
 * The rotating headline pill is the SAME mechanism as the Grahak OS hero and the
 * VayuLok headline, not a lookalike: identical 2400ms interval, identical easings
 * (.16,1,.3,1 for the wipe and the width glide, .34,1.56,.64,1 for the dot pop),
 * identical white entrance shutter and .33em dot. The three pages are meant to
 * animate as one family, so if you retune one, retune all three.
 *
 * COPY IS PROVISIONAL, and carries the owner's positioning: AI worth having reduces
 * cost and complexity, favours real-world utility over scale, and compounds across
 * domains. The rotation is doing argumentative work rather than decoration - the
 * pill cycling through four unrelated domains is the "across every domain" claim
 * enacted rather than asserted, which is why the headline does not need to say it.
 * The sub-line carries the cost/complexity half. To reword, edit CYCLE_WORDS and
 * .home-sub; nothing else depends on the strings.
 *
 * WORD LENGTH IS A DESIGN CONSTRAINT, not a copy detail, for one measured reason:
 * the pill animates to each word's measured width, so the spread between the
 * shortest and longest word is how far the headline's tail travels on every tick.
 * Measured at 1280px by tools/browser/animcheck.js: consumers 278, enterprises 280,
 * climate tech 290, frontier tech 300, AI applications 361. Spread 83px.
 *
 * See the note above CYCLE_WORDS for why "climate" became "climate tech" - briefly,
 * the bare noun was 178px, which made that spread 183px, and it was also the only
 * entry in the set answering a different question from the other four.
 *
 * The real constraint is NOT the spread, it is reflow: the headline growing to a
 * second line on the longest word only would shift every section below it every
 * 2400ms. That cannot happen here because .home-head-line is display:block, so the
 * pill owns its own line and the h1's line count does not depend on the active word.
 * Verified, not assumed: h1 height is constant for every word at all 21 viewports
 * from 320 to 1920, and constant across a live rotation.
 *
 * Re-measure after changing a word: `node tools/browser/animcheck.js`. The harness
 * is in the repo, under tools/browser/, so that instruction stays true across sandbox
 * resets - it used to name a file that existed nowhere on disk.
 *
 * A unit test cannot see reflow, so src/test/HomePage.test.tsx pins only the one
 * thing it can: no word longer than 18 characters, i.e. long enough to still fit
 * the pill's own line at the narrowest breakpoint.
 *
 * The four tint/dot pairs are reused VERBATIM from the Grahak OS hero - no new
 * colours. Hue maps onto sense the way it does on the other two pages: green for our
 * own domain, blue for communication, purple for intelligence, amber for service.
 * Like the channel tints, this per-subject system sits outside the brand palette by
 * design, which is why lime is absent here.
 *
 * The rotating markup MUST stay inline in this return tree. styled-jsx only attaches
 * its scoping class to elements it can statically see there, so lifting the pill into
 * a variable or a child component silently drops every style and the words render
 * stacked with no pill. That has already happened twice on the other two pages.
 *
 * Classes stay home- prefixed. The globally imported src/styles/*.css declares
 * unscoped rules for generic names and styled-jsx does not shield a page from them.

// Module scope, not inside the component: the rotation effect reads .length, and a
// literal declared in the body would make that a changing dependency and force an
// exhaustive-deps suppression the way VayuLok needed one.
// Lowercase: these sit mid-sentence, not at the head of one.
//
// THE SET, AND WHY THESE FOUR, AND WHY THE FRAME SAYS "BUILT FOR".
// `consumers` and `enterprises` are audiences; `climate tech` and `frontier tech` are
// fields. Those are two different axes, and the old frame - "Everyday services for" -
// only accepted the first: "Everyday services for climate tech" does not parse, because
// a field is not something you deliver a service to.
// That is the same test that removed `AI applications`, and it applied just as much to
// these two; leaving them in was inconsistent. Rather than cut half the set, the FRAME
// changed. "Everyday AI, built for" is true of all four - you build for consumers and you
// build for climate tech - and it puts AI back above the fold, which had been lost when
// `AI applications` came out.
// Length was deliberate too: 22 characters against the old frame's 21, so the h1's first
// line keeps its visual weight against the pill below it. "Everyday AI for" was rejected
// at 15 characters for leaving that line visibly short.
// DO NOT re-add `AI applications` under this frame: it renders "Everyday AI, built for AI
// applications", with AI twice, and "applications" is what you build rather than a field
// you build for.
// `AI applications` was removed on the owner’s instruction - see the note below. Every entry stays true on the day a single
// offering changes, which is the property the earlier sets did not have.
//
// NO SERVICE NAMES HERE, EVER. travel, rituals, documents, reflection and disputes
// were each in this array at some point and each named a SERVICE. A service can be
// repriced, renamed or discontinued, and on the day one is, the headline is simply
// false. Channel names (WhatsApp, SMS, email, phone) are fine by contrast - they are
// how we reach people, not what we sell, which is why the Grahak OS hero may rotate
// them and this one may not.
//
// Three words were adjusted from the owner's list for grammar, not meaning:
//   consumer   -> consumers    "services for consumer" is not English
//   enterprise -> enterprises  parallel with consumers
//   ai         -> AI           an initialism, and the rest of the page capitalises it
// Revert any of those if the original wording was deliberate.
//
// `AI applications` WAS DROPPED, and it was the outlier that set the pill’s travel.
// Rendered widths at 1280px, from tools/browser/animcheck.js:
//   consumers 278 | enterprises 280 | climate tech 298 | frontier tech 300
//   (`AI applications` measured 361 and is gone; `climate` measured 178 before it
//    became `climate tech`)
// The spread is now about 22px against 83px before, so the pill barely moves per tick.
//
// THE CONSEQUENCE WORTH KNOWING: AI is now mentioned NOWHERE in the hero. The sub-line
// does not name it either, so the only AI claim on this page is "one AI foundation" in
// the flow section below the fold. That is a positioning decision the owner made
// knowingly; if the hero should carry AI again, the sub-line is the place for it, not
// this rotation - the frame is "Everyday services for ___" and every entry has to be
// something you can serve.
// Bare "climate" was much the shortest word in the set, so the pill's tail swung 183px
// every tick against 83px across the other four - 2.2x the movement for one word.
// `climate tech` measures ~290px, which puts the spread back to ~83px. It also fixes
// the sense: "climate" is a domain, while the other four are audiences or kinds of
// thing we build, so the bare noun was the only entry answering a third question.
// It now reads in parallel with `frontier tech` on both counts.
//
// RE-MEASURE AFTER CHANGING A WORD: `node tools/browser/animcheck.js`. That harness
// lives inside the repo precisely so this instruction stays true - it previously named
// a file that existed nowhere on disk, in this comment and three other places.
//
// REFLOW IS THE REAL CONSTRAINT, not the spread. A headline that grows to a second
// line on the longest word only would shift every section below it every 2400ms. That
// cannot happen on this page because .home-head-line is display:block, so the pill
// owns its own line and the h1's line count is independent of which word is showing -
// measured constant for every word at all 21 viewports from 320 to 1920, and again
// through a live rotation. Do not make the pill inline to save a line: the two sibling
// surfaces that do that, /vayulok/ and /grahak-os/, both reflow at narrow widths.
//
// Every tint/dot pair is reused VERBATIM from the Grahak OS hero and the VayuLok
// rotation - no new colours. Five words, five distinct tints, so no two consecutive
// ticks can share a colour without any ordering effort. Lime is deliberately absent:
// this per-subject hue system sits outside the brand palette, which is reserved for
// our own surfaces.

                Inline after the frame text, the headline's line count depended on
                which word was showing: measured at 1440px, "reflection" pushed the
                h1 from 75px to 138px while the four shorter words fitted one line,
                so every 2400ms the whole page below jumped by 63px. Widening
                max-width only relocates that to a different viewport - with a word
                whose width varies by 156px inside flowing text, some width will
                always split the line for the long word and not the short one.
                Giving the pill its own block makes line count independent of word

                  ON "AI FOUNDATION", WHICH HAS NOW GONE BOTH WAYS. It was cut from this
                  lead on the reasoning that the three beats below describe single sign-on,
                  multichannel delivery and automatic retry - none of which is AI - and that
                  labelling plumbing as AI invites a reader to discount the honest parts.
                  The owner then confirmed the positioning, so "AI" was restored here - and
                  has now come out again, because the HERO carries it: the h1 frame reads
                  "Everyday AI, built for". Saying "one AI foundation" one screen below that
                  put AI twice in quick succession, which is the same redundancy this section
                  was cleaned up to remove. The page still says AI once, above the fold, where
                  positioning belongs. The distinction that
                  made it honest while it was here: "one AI foundation" described the
                  PLATFORM the services share, not a claim that each beat below is itself AI. Keep
                  it that way - if a beat ever asserts AI, it needs something behind it.
                  "Nothing falls between them" replaces "You never have to manage the joins
                  between them", which was awkward and put the reader in charge of plumbing
                  they were just told not to think about. */}

                  still true as a rule. The owner has since scoped it differently: the home
                  page does not promote WhatsApp. "Updates reach you wherever you already
                  are" carries the meaning without naming any channel.
                  Naming SMS, email and phone while omitting WhatsApp was the one option
                  ruled out - in India that reads as an oversight rather than a choice.
                  THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE HOME PAGE. /grahak-os/ is deliberately
                  WhatsApp-led and its hero still rotates the four channels; do not
                  propagate this edit there. The floating WhatsApp support button stays on
                  every public page including this one - it is a way to reach us, not a
                  claim about what we sell.
                  Beat 1 names no auth mechanism either: no account, no sign-in, no OTP.
                  That was "One account. One continuous experience. / Sign in once..." and
                  promised a login model the owner has not committed to. */}

          {/* THE CLOSING BAND, AND WHY IT IS NOT A SERVICE DIRECTORY ANY MORE.
              This slot held a ten-card grid listing every service by name. The owner's
              objection was that the list is not a fixed set - it is an internal, moving
              inventory - so publishing it on the home page made a promise about scope that
              would be wrong again every time something was added or retired. A closing
              argument does not go stale; a roster does.

              NOTHING IS ORPHANED BY REMOVING IT. Every product page is still linked from
              the header mega-menu, which renders on all sixteen public routes, and all of
              them are still in the sitemap - so the internal linking that made the grid
              worth having is intact without the home page having to enumerate anything.

              THE ANIMATION IS SCROLL-TRIGGERED, NOT LOOPING, and that is the point. There
              are already two continuously moving things above this - the rotating headline
              and the streaming panel - so a third loop would compete with both. This
              reveals once when it comes into view: the lime rule draws itself across and
              the three lines stagger in behind it, which lands the argument and then stops. */}

                  a capitalised component, because it cannot know whether the component
