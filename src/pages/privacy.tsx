/**
 * /privacy — Privacy Policy.
 *
 * NOW IN THE MENU. It was deliberately unlinked while the text was a placeholder; the
 * owner has since asked for it to be listed, and with the real policy in place that is
 * the right call - a privacy policy nobody can find from the site is close to useless,
 * and app stores and payment providers expect a discoverable link.
 *
 * ROUTING: '/privacy' is in the EXACT-MATCH allowlist in _app.tsx. Without that entry
 * this renders an empty body with HTTP 200. trailingSlash means the URL is /privacy/.
 *
 * THE REAL POLICY - 24 sections plus the sub-clauses of 3 and 10. The text originally
 * came from the old Wix site; it has since been rewritten into plain English on the
 * owner's instruction, and THIS REPO IS NOW THE SOURCE OF TRUTH - there is no upstream
 * page to sync with. src/content/legal/privacy.ts records what the rewrite changed and
 * what it deliberately left alone, including why it did not invent specifics about which
 * data each service collects.
 *
 * noindex was removed with the placeholder. A privacy policy should be indexable.
