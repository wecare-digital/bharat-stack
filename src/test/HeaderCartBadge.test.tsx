/**
 * THE SHOPPING BAG IN THE HEADER, and specifically the two things about it that are true or false
 * rather than visual.
 *
 * jsdom cannot read a computed style, so the chip's geometry, the 44px tap target and the glyph's
 * colour are measured in a real browser - tools/browser/devicecheck.js carries all four
 * transactional routes now and asserts every header control clears 44px at fifteen postures,
 * including 280px where the header has the least room. What jsdom CAN decide is the count logic and
 * the accessible name, and the count logic has a trap that only a test will catch.
 *
 * THE TRAP IS HYDRATION. The cart is in localStorage and these pages are statically exported, so the
 * server render has no cart. If the component rendered a count during the first client render it
 * would have to render 0 - which is a different tree from the server's only if the server somehow
 * knew better, and either way it is a guess shown to a shopper who has three items. So `null` means
 * "not read yet", is distinct from 0, and shows no badge at all; the number appears only after the
 * effect has run. These tests pin that: the FIRST render carries no digits even when storage is
 * already populated.
