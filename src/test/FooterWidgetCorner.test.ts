/**
 * THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER BELONGS TO THE SUPPORT PILL, AND TO NOTHING ELSE.
 *
 * Two files have to agree about that and neither imports the other, which is how they came
 * to disagree. Footer.tsx put the lime brand dash in the bottom-right of the footer;
 * SupportWidget.tsx pins a fixed pill to the bottom-right of the viewport. At the end of the
 * page they occupied the same space:
 *
 *   1440   the pill covered 34px of the 56px dash
 *   768    the dash was ENTIRELY behind the pill
 *   412    they cleared by 8px, which flips to an overlap on a taller device
 *   phones the pill landed inside the footer at all seven sizes
 *
 * The dash was ALSO in the wrong place on its own terms: the instruction for this footer was
 * that the right side be blank, and the dash was the only thing in it.
 *
 * Two changes answer it, and this file pins both because either one alone leaves the
 * collision reachable: the dash moved into the brand block, and below 768px the pill parks
 * above the footer instead of descending into it.
 *
 * uicheck.js asserts the RESULT - that the pill covers no footer content at four widths, at
 * the end of the page. These assertions pin the MECHANISM, so a change that happens to look
 * fine at those four widths still has to be deliberate.
