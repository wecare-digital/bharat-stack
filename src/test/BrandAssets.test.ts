/**
 * The brand assets, and which slot each one is allowed in.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * One file was doing three jobs and was the wrong file for two of them. `wecaredigital.png`
 * fed og:image, twitter:image, apple-touch-icon, the schema.org Organization logo AND both PWA
 * manifest icons. Measured from the live object in s3://wecare-digital-get/o/stream/media/m/:
 *
 *   wecaredigital.png    1080x1080  PNG colour-type 6 (RGBA)  68.4% FULLY TRANSPARENT
 *                        corner and centre both rgba(0,0,0,0), and the mark itself is black
 *   wecare-digital.png   1080x1080  0% transparent, white ground
 *   wd-brand-16x9.png    1440x810   PNG colour-type 2 (RGB) — no alpha channel at all
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE IS INVISIBLE FROM INSIDE THE PAGE, which is exactly why it needs a test.
 * og:image and apple-touch-icon are composited by someone else's renderer, and neither
 * guarantees a light backdrop — Apple has flattened apple-touch-icon alpha to black since
 * iOS 7, and link-preview renderers flatten to black or to their own surface colour. A black
 * mark on a flattened black ground is an invisible logo. Every check that looks at our own
 * HTML passes while the shared link renders as a black square.
 *
 * So the rule is a rule about ALPHA, not about filenames: any asset handed to a renderer we do
 * not control must be opaque. `wecaredigital.png` is not banned from the repo — it is the
 * correct asset for an <img> on our own known-white page. It is banned from these five slots.
 *
 * The second half is shape. twitter:card is `summary_large_image`, and a 1:1 image in that slot
 * is centre-cropped — it cut the top and bottom off the mark. og:image:width/height also
 * declared 512x512 while the file was 1080x1080, so the hint crawlers use to reserve layout
 * was wrong even about the wrong asset.
