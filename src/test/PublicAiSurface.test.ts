/**
 * HOLDS THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PUBLIC SURFACE IN STEP.
 *
 * The site's public page set is stated in four places, in three languages, because the
 * consumers cannot share a module: a React allowlist, a Node sitemap generator, a Node
 * llms.txt generator, and a Python Lambda.
 *
 *   src/pages/_app.tsx                PUBLIC_PAGE_META + the render chains (render allowlist)
 *   scripts/generate-sitemap.js       PUBLIC_EXACT                        (crawl allowlist)
 *   config/public-pages.json          the catalogue        (llms.txt + the MCP server's zip)
 *   amplify/functions/ai/mcp/         READ_ONLY_TOOLS, PROTOCOL_VERSIONS  (what /mcp serves)
 *
 * IT WAS FIVE UNTIL 2026-09-30. `src/lib/ai-surface.ts` restated the endpoint URL, the three
 * protocol versions and the five tool names in TypeScript so the /llm page could render them.
 * Both are gone: the page is retired and its content moved into config/public-pages.json,
 * which the MCP server and the llms.txt generator already read. One fewer copy is one fewer
 * thing this file has to hold in step, and the tests that guarded it now guard the JSON.
 *
 * Every remaining pair can drift, and each drift is silent in its own way:
 *
 *   catalogue has a page _app.tsx does not    -> llms.txt advertises a URL that serves the
 *                                                staff sign-in shell at HTTP 200
 *   _app.tsx has a page the catalogue lacks   -> the page is invisible to every agent
 *   ai_surface disagrees with the handler     -> /llms.txt advertises tools that do not exist,
 *                                                and an operator configures a client to them
 *   robots.txt AI group loses a Disallow      -> a named crawler is granted /workspace/
 *
 * Nothing catches any of those at runtime. PublicRouteRegistration.test.ts already guards the
 * first two columns; this file guards the rest, and follows its technique of reading source as
 * TEXT rather than importing it - importing _app.tsx would execute Amplify.configure at module
 * scope, and the values under assertion are literals in the file rather than runtime exports.
