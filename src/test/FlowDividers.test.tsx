/**
 * Band 2's three beat dividers.
 *
 * The owner picked option B from docs/divider-review — three colours rather than one, and no
 * animation. This pins the two things that were measured on the way to building it, both of
 * which the mock got wrong or did not ask.
 *
 * 1. THE MOCK'S COLOURS WERE NOT SHIPPABLE. It offered amber #f0a818, purple #9849e8 and green
 *    #3da35a and claimed in its own cost table that all three clear 3:1 on white. Amber is
 *    2.04:1. Blue #2563eb (5.17:1) replaces it. Red #dc2626 clears 3:1 too and was rejected
 *    for meaning rather than measurement: on "Follow-ups happen automatically" a red rule
 *    reads as a warning about the thing described.
 *
 * 2. WHY 3:1 AT ALL, given these rules are decorative and lime shipped at 1.24:1. WCAG 1.4.11
 *    covers graphics required to understand content, and each beat's text is complete without
 *    its rule — so the floor is not borrowed from the guideline, it is borrowed from the
 *    reason for the change. Once three bars differ, the difference is meant to be perceived,
 *    and 2.04:1 beside 4.72:1 reads as one washed-out bar and two solid ones.
 *
 * NOT ASSERTING 1.4.1 (Use of Colour), deliberately: the beats are told apart by their own
 * sentences and the colours encode nothing. If a bar colour is ever given a meaning, that
 * needs a second non-colour signal and this test needs a new case.
