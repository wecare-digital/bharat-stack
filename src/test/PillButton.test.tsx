/**
 * The two-segment pill, the home-page phone-number treatment turned reusable and applied to every
 * customer login CTA. jsdom cannot compute styled-jsx, so the colours and the pill radius are the
 * browser harness's job; here we pin the two properties that keep the login flow and its tests
 * working no matter how the pill looks:
 *
 *   1. THE ACCESSIBLE NAME. The visible pill is two words, but the control must answer to the ACTION
 *      alone - that is the name AccountSignIn.test / CartCheckout.test query ("Send code",
 *      "Confirm code", "Proceed to checkout"). A regression here breaks the login tests silently, so
 *      it is asserted directly: the name is the action, or the ariaLabel override when given, and the
 *      static label is NOT part of it.
 *   2. REAL CONTROL SEMANTICS. A submit button submits, a disabled pill does not fire onClick, and an
 *      as="a" pill is a link with an href - the pill is a style on a real control, never a div.
 *
 * Plus a source-level check that the measured contrast tokens are the ones actually in the file, so
 * the dark-green/mint pair the briefing signed off on cannot drift to a failing shade unnoticed.

/**
 * TWO CONTRACTS MET AT ONCE, and the history is worth recording because each looked complete on
 * its own.
 *
 * The ORIGINAL contract asserted the name was the ACTION ALONE and that the visible label must
 * NOT appear in it ("Send code", never "Sign in Send code"), achieved with `aria-hidden` on both
 * segments plus an `aria-label`. That hid a control's own visible label from its accessible name,
 * so a speech-input user saying "click Sign in" at that button got nothing. WCAG 2.5.3 Label in
 * Name is Level A and requires the opposite: the name must CONTAIN the visible text.
 *
 * Upstream fixed that by un-hiding both segments so the name became the platform's concatenation,
 * "Sign in Send code", and removed the `ariaLabel` override from the component entirely.
 *
 * THE OWNER THEN RETIRED THE TWO-TONE PILL (2026-10-02, "old multi colour out of date"), so there
 * is now ONE lime surface showing the ACTION only. That satisfies 2.5.3 by construction rather
 * than by repair: with a single visible string, the accessible name and the visible text are the
 * same string and cannot disagree. The `ariaLabel` removal is kept - it is what stops a caller
 * reopening the failure - and no segment is aria-hidden.

   * THE REGRESSION THAT SHIPPED TO PRODUCTION, and the reason this test exists.

   * The two segments were once hoisted into a single `const inner = (<>...</>)` and referenced from
   * both the <a> and <button> branches. styled-jsx's transform only stamps its scoping hash class
   * onto JSX inside the same return tree as the <style jsx> element, so hoisted JSX was never
   * stamped: the built markup emitted `class="pill-label"` / `class="pill-action"` with NO hash,
   * while the rules compiled to `.pill-label.jsx-<hash>{...}`. Those selectors could not match.
   * The outer control WAS stamped, so the pill kept its shape, its 2px edge and its dark fill
   * while neither segment got its own background or colour - it rendered as one dark slab reading
   * "Sign inSend code". It was live on /account/sign-in/ in that state.
   *
   * STILL RELEVANT AFTER THE TWO-TONE RETIREMENT. The pill is now ONE lime surface with a single
   * .pill-action span, so there is one span per branch rather than two - but the hoisting hazard
   * is unchanged: lift that span into a variable and styled-jsx stops stamping it, and the label
   * loses its colour and centring exactly as both segments did before.
   *
   * jsdom cannot compute styled-jsx, so this is asserted on the SOURCE: the span must appear
   * exactly TWICE - once inside each branch's own return tree - and never be assigned to a
   * variable or produced by a helper.
