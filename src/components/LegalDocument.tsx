/**
 * Renders a long legal document on the site's own type system.
 *
 * SELF-STYLING, like BrandBadge, RotatingHero and WorkflowTerminal: styled-jsx cannot
 * scope a composite component from its parent, so this owns every rule it needs.
 *
 * Classes are lgd- prefixed. The globally imported src/styles/*.css declares unscoped
 * rules for generic names and styled-jsx does not shield a page from them.
 *
 * The TABLE OF CONTENTS is not decoration. Terms is 57 sections and Privacy is 39; a
 * flat wall of numbered prose is unusable on a phone, which is where a privacy policy
 * actually gets opened. Top-level sections only - listing 14.1 through 14.12 as well
 * would make the contents as long as the document.
 *
 * TYPE COMES OFF THE DESIGN CONTRACT, with one deliberate exception. The contract pins
 * exactly one body level at 20px/400 for marketing pages. That is too large for 42,000
 * characters of clauses: at 20px this document runs to a scroll depth nobody reaches.
 * Body here is 17px on a 68-character measure, which is inside the 45-75 the rest of
 * the site holds to. Headings still use the contract's rungs, so the page reads as part
 * of the same family. This is the one place a smaller body level is justified and it is
 * confined to this component.

   * the suite checked the reading column width and the deep-link offset but never the
   * vertical distance between two children.
