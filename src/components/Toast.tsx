   * THE HOLD IS A TIMER. THE EXIT IS NOT.
   *
   * This used to be a timer inside a timer: after the hold it set the exit class and then called
   * `setTimeout(() => onRemove(id), 300)` to unmount once the animation had finished. The 300 was
   * a guess at the CSS duration, and it was the WRONG guess - `.toast-exit` in
   * styles/inner-ux.css animates for 0.2s, so the toast sat fully transparent for 100ms on every
   * dismissal, and the container held a dead node that still occupied its grid gap.
   *
   * Two numbers describing one duration in two languages will always drift; the only question is
   * how long before somebody notices. So the exit is now driven by `animationend` below. The
   * stylesheet owns how long leaving takes, and retiming the animation needs no change here.
   *
   * WHY THE HOLD STAYS IN JS: CSS cannot unmount a React node, and driving the whole lifecycle
   * from one long animation would put the READING TIME under prefers-reduced-motion too - a
   * reduced-motion reader would get a toast that vanished in 0.01ms. Reduce motion means do not
   * animate, not do not wait.

   * identifier that a future stylesheet rename or a minifier could change, and nothing would fail
   * loudly - toasts would simply stop being removed.

  /**
   * A BACKSTOP, NOT A SECOND DURATION - and the distinction is the whole reason it is safe to have.
   *
   * `animationend` is what normally removes this, and the stylesheet owns how long leaving takes.
   * But an animation that never runs never ends: an element hidden before it started, a browser
   * that does not implement AnimationEvent, a stylesheet that failed to load. In any of those the
   * toast would sit in the corner permanently, which is a worse failure than a slightly early
   * unmount.
   *
   * That is not hypothetical. jsdom has no AnimationEvent at all - React does not even deliver
   * `animationend` there, verified by probing it directly - so under test this timer is the only
   * thing that removes a toast.
   *
   * One second is an UPPER BOUND rather than a matched value. It is far longer than any exit this
   * design would plausibly use (the current one is 0.2s), so it never pre-empts the animation, and
   * because it is not trying to equal the CSS it cannot drift out of step with it the way the old
   * 300ms did.
