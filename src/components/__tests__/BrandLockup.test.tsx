   * nodes, and with neither protected both were collected and sent to the translation
   * provider as ordinary English words. On the live site Arabic came back as
   * "نحن نهتم. رقمي" - a literal rendering of "we care" and "digital" - and Hindi produced
   * "WECARE." followed by "डिजिटल", so the wordmark came apart mid-brand.
   *
   * Measured on the built export before the fix: 4 translatable brand text nodes on every
   * route, two from the header lockup and two from the footer's compact one.
   *
   * The flag belongs on the ROOT, not on .brand-copy: `suffix` is a ReactNode a consumer
   * can pass in, and an attribute on the inner wordmark span would leave it unprotected.
