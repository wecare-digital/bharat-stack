/**
 * Head for one page of the blog index.
 *
 * STRUCTURED DATA IS DECLARED HERE, not in _app.tsx.
 *
 * /blog/ is in `isContentPublic`, and _app.tsx renders its shared <Head> behind
 * `!isContentPublic` - so the Organization, WebSite, WebPage and BreadcrumbList graph every
 * other public route gets is deliberately suppressed on /blog/ and /post/[slug]/, to stop two
 * components emitting competing canonicals. The consequence went unnoticed once: /blog/ is in
 * the sitemap and indexable but shipped ZERO JSON-LD, while the structured data checker only
 * looked at six hardcoded routes and never asked about this one.
 *
 * THE GRAPH IS SELF-CONTAINED ON PURPOSE. It cannot reference the shared nodes by @id -
 * `#website` and `#organization` are defined in the <Head> that is suppressed here, so
 * pointing at them would emit references that resolve to nothing, which is worse than
 * omitting them. Publisher is therefore inlined.
 *
 * WHAT PAGINATION ADDED TO THIS FILE
 * ----------------------------------
 * EVERY PAGE IS SELF-CANONICAL. /blog/page/7/ canonicalises to itself, NOT to /blog/. It is
 * tempting to point all 35 pages at /blog/, and it is wrong: a canonical says "index this
 * other URL instead of me", so 810 posts whose only listing is on pages 2-35 would have no
 * indexable page linking to them at all. Google's own guidance on paginated sequences is that
 * each page is its own canonical.
 *
 * rel=prev/next IS STILL EMITTED although Google retired it as an indexing signal in 2019. It
 * remains the correct semantic relationship between these documents, browsers and reading
 * tools use it to offer "next page", and nothing costs anything by its presence.
 *
 * PAGES 2 AND UP ARE index,follow, not noindex. noindex on a paginated tail is the other
 * common mistake: it removes the only crawlable route to most of the corpus. What they do get
 * is a DISTINCT <title> and description carrying the page number, because 35 pages sharing one
 * title is what actually reads as duplicate content in a search result list.
 *
 * ONLY THE Blog NODE CARRIES THE POST COUNT, and it sits on page 1. The pages describe
 * themselves as parts of one Blog via `isPartOf`.
 *
 * EVERY LISTING PAGE NOW ALSO CARRIES AN ItemList, and this paragraph used to say it must not.
 * The reason given was that "repeating an itemListElement of 24 posts on every page would
 * describe 35 overlapping collections". That is factually wrong, and it was measured rather
 * than argued: across all 54 listing pages in the export - /blog/, /blog/page/2..35/,
 * /blog/topic/gastronomy/ and its 18 pages - ZERO posts appear on more than one listing page,
 * and all 1279 are linked from exactly one. The slices are perfectly DISJOINT, so an ItemList
 * per page describes 54 non-overlapping collections, each one exactly what that page contains.
 *
 * Without it, 54 pages declared themselves CollectionPage and then said nothing about what they
 * collected. ItemList is the property Google documents for that, and it is derived from the
 * same `posts` array the view renders, so a new post, a new page or a new category stream is
 * described the moment it exists - there is nothing to author and nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * `itemListOrder` is deliberately NOT emitted. The rendered order is carried by `position`,
 * which is true by construction; naming an order would be a claim about the sort that this
 * component does not perform and has not verified.
