/**
 * PageMeta - the per-page half of the document head.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Thirteen public pages each declared the same three-line Head by hand:
 * a <title>, a <meta name="description">, and a keyed canonical. None of them declared
 * og: or twitter: tags, and only /grahak-os/ does. Everything else therefore inherited the
 * SITEWIDE share preview from _app.tsx, which means /contact/, /terms/, /privacy/,
 * /my-order/, /bharat-rx/, /vayulok/ and all seven product pages shared ONE og:title and
 * ONE og:description between them - measured on the built export, fourteen routes previewed
 * as "Everyday AI, built for Bharat | WECARE.DIGITAL" with the company description.
 *
 * Every one of those pages already had good, owner-written title and description copy. The
 * share tags simply were not wired to it. So this component takes the strings the page
 * already passes and emits the whole set from them - no new copy, and no second place to
 * edit when the copy changes, which is the part that matters: a page whose og:title is a
 * hand-copied duplicate of its <title> drifts the first time one of them is edited.
 *
 * THE og: KEYS ARE LOAD-BEARING. next/head de-duplicates meta by `name`, `httpEquiv`,
 * `charSet` and `itemProp` - `property` is NOT on that list, so two og:title tags coexist
 * where two twitter:title tags collapse to one. /grahak-os/ shipped two of every og tag
 * for exactly this reason until matching keys were added on both sides. The keys here must
 * stay character-identical to the ones in src/pages/_app.tsx, or these tags will be added
 * alongside the sitewide ones instead of replacing them. Verify with:
 *   grep -o '"og:title"' out/contact/index.html | wc -l   # must be 1
 * twitter: tags need no key - they are keyed on `name` already.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS IN _app.tsx: og:type, og:image, og:image:width, og:image:height, og:site_name,
 * og:locale, twitter:card, twitter:image and the robots/verification/PWA block. Those are
 * genuinely sitewide and no page overrides them.
