/**
 * THE INDIAN STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES THE DELIVERY FORM OFFERS - display names only.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND COPY OF A PYTHON TABLE EXISTS
 * ------------------------------------------
 * The address form must not let a customer type a state the server cannot map. A free-text state
 * is the unmapped-state failure class: the save succeeds, and then pay time refuses with
 * UNMAPPABLE_STATE on a value the customer has no way to correct, because nothing tells them
 * which spelling the server wanted. A select over this table removes that class at source - the
 * only states on offer are the ones the tax table resolves.
 *
 * THESE ARE DISPLAY NAMES, NEVER ISO CODES. The server resolves a NAME through
 * lambda_utils.ecommerce.wix_address.india_subdivision, and the ISO 3166-2 code plus the GST
 * state code it returns are a server-side tax concern. A browser that posted IN-KA would be
 * relying on a lookup branch that exists for legacy rows, not for this form.
 *
 * THE NAMES MUST BE THE EXACT TITLE-CASE OF THE 36 wix_address.INDIA_SUBDIVISIONS KEYS.
 * Specifically including "Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu" (one merged union territory
 * since 2020, not two) and "Delhi" - NOT "NCT of Delhi", which lives in the separate
 * INDIA_ALIASES table. That table is a lookup convenience for spellings seen in real data and in
 * Google Places output; it is not part of the key set, so offering an alias here would be
 * offering a name that is not canonical.
 *
 * PINNED BY tests/test_india_subdivision_drift.py, BECAUSE THIS TABLE DECIDES THE TAX.
 * The subdivision is the place of supply, which decides the CGST/SGST versus IGST split. A state
 * this file offers but the Python table cannot map is a dead-end loop for the customer and a
 * wrong tax split if it ever got through, so the two sides are compared in CI. The server
 * lowercases before lookup, so the comparison is case-insensitive and only the SET of names is
 * pinned - not their order, which is alphabetical here purely so the select is scannable.
 *
 * ONE CONSTRAINT ON EDITING THIS FILE: the drift test collects every single-quoted literal in the
 * whole source, so no other single-quoted string may appear anywhere in it, comments included.
 * Use double quotes in prose, as above.
