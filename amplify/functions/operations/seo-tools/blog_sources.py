"""Blog source intake: presigned upload, a durable source record, and the async worker.

THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE SYNCHRONOUS REQUEST.

API Gateway cuts a Lambda integration off at 30 seconds. Extracting one PDF is fast;
extracting fifty is not, and "thousands in one go" is the stated requirement. So the work is
split into three phases that each fit comfortably inside their own limit:

  1. `POST /seo-tools/blog-sources`         register N sources, return N presigned PUT URLs.
                                            No bytes touch this function.
  2. browser PUTs each file straight to S3   the only step whose duration scales with size,
                                            and it happens outside our compute entirely.
  3. `POST /seo-tools/blog-sources/confirm`  head_object each key, then hand off to the
                                            worker with InvocationType='Event' and return.

The worker then runs OUTSIDE the API Gateway request, so its ceiling is the function
timeout rather than 30s, and it CHAINS: it processes a bounded batch, and if sources remain
it re-invokes itself. A 2,000-source run is therefore a sequence of short invocations that
can be interrupted and resumed, rather than one long one that cannot.

Resolve-before-generate is enforced here exactly as `scripts/blog_ledger.py` enforces it
locally: the record id is derived from the sha256 of the source bytes, so re-uploading the
same PDF lands on the row that already exists instead of minting a second article. That is
the one failure in this pipeline that cannot be undone after publication.

#: THE PUBLIC ROOT, BY OWNER INSTRUCTION, AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS REAL.
#:
#: `o/` is the public root of this bucket: CloudFront distribution E2GP22R4BIFGQ3 serves it
#: at `https://wecare.digital/get/o/...` with no authentication. `secure/` is the gated root,
#: denied wholesale at the edge. This prefix began as `secure/blog-src/` and was moved to
#: `o/` on owner instruction, confirmed a second time on 2026-09-29 to cover derived
#: artefacts too - so a source document AND its extracted text are fetchable by anyone who
#: has the URL.
#:
#: What limits the exposure, stated so nobody over-credits it:
#:   - Keys are content hashes or record ids, so they are not guessable and not derivable
#:     from the filename.
#:   - Bucket listing is not public - all four public-access-block settings are on and the
#:     bucket policy grants s3:GetObject only to the CloudFront service principal.
#: So a source is unlisted-but-public: safe from enumeration, not safe once a URL leaks.
#:
#: That matters because these are third-party documents - books, journal articles, pages -
#: and a public URL is a public copy. If that becomes unacceptable, the fix is to move the
#: prefix back under `secure/` and let the existing edge deny cover it; nothing else in this
#: module has to change, because the key is composed through `media_paths` below.
BUCKET = os.environ.get("BLOG_SOURCE_BUCKET", os.environ.get("SECURE_FILES_BUCKET", "wecare-digital-get"))

#: Composed through `media_paths` rather than hand-built, which that module explicitly asks
#: for: "Keep composing keys through `public` and `secure` rather than hand-building them."
#: It also documents why `o/` is load-bearing and cannot simply be dropped.
#:
#: Renamed from `o/blog-src/` to `o/blog-production/` on 2026-09-29, while the prefix held
#: ZERO objects. That made it a constant change rather than a data migration, and it is the
#: last moment at which that was true.

#: 300-page book is roughly 450 kB of text on its own, and `MAX_SOURCE_BYTES` allows a 40 MB
#: PDF - so the write failed on precisely the documents this pipeline exists to process,
#: while working fine on every small test fixture.
#:
#: So the text goes to `extracted/<sourceId>.md` and the item keeps a bounded preview plus
#: the key. The preview is what the admin list renders; the full text is fetched on demand.

#: ONE PROJECTED ATTRIBUTE FOR THE WHOLE PIPELINE, AND THE REASON IS A HARD AWS LIMIT.
#:
#: DynamoDB caps a GSI's `NonKeyAttributes` at 20 names. `batchId-createdAt-index` already
#: spends 17 of them, and the remaining stages each want their own state on a batch listing -
#: which analysis was read, which template version the article was written to, which QA run
#: and sign-off it rests on, whether it published, whether verification passed. That is seven
#: more names against three free slots, so adding them one at a time hits the wall partway
#: through and the fix at that point is recreating a populated index.
#:
#: A MAP COUNTS AS ONE NAME. So every downstream stage writes into `pipeline`, the index
#: projects that single attribute, and the cap stops being a design constraint. It was worth
#: doing the moment the second stage arrived rather than the last: a GSI's projection cannot
#: be modified in place, so widening it means deleting and recreating the index, which is free
#: today at zero records and a migration once a wave is in flight.
#:
#: Written whole rather than by nested path: `SET pipeline.qaRunId = :v` fails outright on an
#: item that has no `pipeline` yet, and there is no single expression that can both create the
#: map and set a key inside it. `update_pipeline` therefore reads, merges and writes - the same
#: read-modify-write `draftRecord` has always used, with the same bounded race (two operators
