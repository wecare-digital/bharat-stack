"""Production batches: a parent record, and rollups derived from the children.

THE ONE RULE THIS MODULE IS BUILT AROUND.

Every count is computed by reading the source records. There is no `extractedCount` attribute
on a batch that something increments.

That is a requirement rather than a preference - the specification says "Derive all totals
from actual records" and "Never maintain unrelated manually incremented counters" - and the
reason is that a counter and the records it claims to count drift apart at exactly the moment
you need them to agree. A worker that crashes after writing the source status but before
incrementing the batch leaves a batch that says 2,499 of 2,500 forever, and no amount of
re-running fixes it because the increment is not idempotent. A derived count cannot be wrong;
it can only be expensive, and `batchId-createdAt-index` is what makes it cheap.

## Why a dedicated GSI rather than filtering the record-type partition

`storage.list_records` clamps at 500 items. A batch is specified to hold thousands. Filtering
the `blogSource` partition in Python would also read every source in the system to report on
one batch.

The index projects only what a rollup and the sources table need - `INCLUDE`, not `ALL`.
The item carries `extractPreview` (1,500 characters) and `draftRecord`, and projecting those
into the index would roughly double the storage for data no listing renders. That is a
deliberate cost decision, not an oversight.

## What a batch does NOT do

It does not publish, and completing does not imply publishing. Section 38 is explicit:
"Processing completion must never automatically mean publishing." A batch reaching
`COMPLETE` means every source has an article in some state, not that anything is live.

    because the rollup is the thing the caller just read. The stored value stays as a
