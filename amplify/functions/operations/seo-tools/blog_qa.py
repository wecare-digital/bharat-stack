"""QA runs and gate sign-offs: two records, one of them signed by a person.

THE SPLIT THIS MODULE ENFORCES.

Generation produces an article. QA produces a verdict on it. A sign-off is a person accepting
that verdict and taking responsibility for the eleven judgements no program can make. Before
this they were one motion - generate, assess, and the status came out the other end - which
means the only artifact was a status field, and a status field cannot answer "who decided this,
what did they see, and was it still true when it published".

So there are two records and they are both immutable:

  `blogQaRun`      what every rule said about one exact version of the article, with the body
                   hash it ran against, the template version, the corpus coverage, and the
                   analysis the writing rested on.
  `blogGateSignoff` a person's answers to the eleven section 29 human gates and the section 30
                   read, naming the QA run they relied on and the body hash they saw.

## Four refusals, and why each one is a refusal rather than a warning

1. **No sign-off without a QA run.** Signing for an article nobody ran the rules against is
   the whole failure mode.
2. **No sign-off when the run is stale.** The run records the body hash; if the article has
   moved since, the verdict describes different text.
3. **No sign-off when the run did not check the corpus.** Section 28 duplication needs the
   1,165-post index. A run that could not load it reports NON_DUPLICATION on an unchecked
   corpus, and a signature over that is a signature over nothing.
4. **No sign-off over a blocking finding.** A human may accept a REVIEW - that is what
   judgement is for - but a BLOCK is a mechanical fact, and overriding it by signature would
   make the mechanical half advisory.

## What a sign-off cannot do

It cannot publish. It makes READY_TO_PUBLISH reachable; releasing is a separate operator action
in `blog_publish`, which checks for a sign-off that is still valid at that moment. And it is
not stored on the article: `blog_gate.resolved_gate` derives it on every assessment and drops it
the instant the body hash moves, so an edit after signing revokes the signature with no
revocation code existing to be forgotten.

#:
#: Sections 5 and 28 require eight explicit yes/no answers, and section 20 requires a review
#: flag per factual domain the article touches. Until this module existed, NOTHING could write
#: any of them: they are correctly absent from `blog_draft.WRITABLE_FIELDS`, because a model
#: declaring its own output non-duplicative is worthless, and there was no human route either.
#:
#: The consequence was not a warning. `decide_status` routes an unanswered section 5 flag to
#: DEDUPE_REWORK, so READY_TO_PUBLISH was structurally UNREACHABLE and the entire publish path
#: was dead code that looked finished. The QA sign-off is where these belong - the same person
#: answering the eleven judgements is the person who has just read the duplication report.
#:
#: Each carries the answer the standard demands. Declaring `titleOnlyDifference: YES` is a
#: statement that this is the same article under a new name, so it is refused rather than
#: recorded: an operator saying that has told us not to publish it.
