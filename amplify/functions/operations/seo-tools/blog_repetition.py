"""Collection-level repetition: the failure mode where no two articles are duplicates.

WHY THE PER-ARTICLE DEDUPE GATE IS NOT ENOUGH.

`blog_quality_v2.CorpusIndex` answers "is this article too close to an existing one". Run 500
articles through it and every one can pass while the collection is obviously machine-made,
because the thing that gives it away is not overlap between any two articles. It is that 340 of
them open the same way, 420 use the same four connectives, and every single one has a mean
sentence length of 17 words. Each article is individually defensible. The wave is not.

That is the specific risk of bulk generation, and it is invisible to a gate that only ever looks
at one record at a time. Section 13 of the standard names the symptom - stock construction,
uniform cadence, repeated opener - but checks it within an article, where three stock phrases is
the threshold. Across a collection the threshold that matters is a PROPORTION.

So this module reports two different things:

  pairs     near-duplicate pairs inside the batch, which the per-article gate cannot see
            because it compares against the published corpus, not against siblings still in
            flight
  patterns  openers, closers, title shapes, phrase concentration and cadence spread, measured
            across the whole collection

## It is advisory, deliberately, and that is not weakness

Nothing here blocks a publish. A proportion is not a defect in any individual article - the
fiftieth article to open with "Something was counting on" is not worse than the first, and
picking one to refuse would be arbitrary. What a reviewer needs is the list and the numbers, so
they can decide which ones to send back. `pipeline.repetitionStatus` records IMPLICATED so a
batch listing can show it, and the release path does not read it.

The exception is the pair check: a near-duplicate PAIR is a real defect and it routes through
the existing dedupe machinery rather than being reported here twice. This module records it and
sets the status; `blog_qa.run` catches it as a finding through `CorpusIndex` once the sibling is
published.

## The pair sweep is not O(n squared) in sketch comparisons

2,500 articles is 3.1 million pairs, and each comparison unions two 128-element sketches. That
does not finish inside a Lambda.

Two sketches that share NO hash values have an estimated Jaccard of exactly zero -
`sketch_jaccard` takes the k smallest of the union and counts values present in both, so an
empty intersection gives 0/k. That makes an inverted index on hash values an EXACT prefilter,
not a heuristic: build `hash -> articles`, and only pairs appearing together under some hash can
possibly score above zero. On real prose that reduces the candidate set by orders of magnitude,
and the pairs it discards are provably below any positive threshold.
