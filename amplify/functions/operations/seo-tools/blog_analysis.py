"""Source analysis as a first-class, versioned record - evidence, not an opinion.

WHY THIS IS NOT A FIELD ON THE SOURCE ROW.

Section 2 of the quality standard is the one clause the rest of the pipeline rests on: an
article may not be built from a title, an excerpt or metadata. Somebody has to have read the
source. Before this module that claim was a single boolean, `sourceReviewedFully`, and a
boolean is not auditable - it records that a click happened, not what was read or when, and a
re-extraction silently left it standing over text nobody had seen.

So the analysis is its own record with its own id and its own version. Three properties
follow, and each of them is the reason for the shape:

1. **Versioned, never overwritten.** Re-analysing a source produces v2 and leaves v1 exactly
   as the reviewer found it. A reviewer's sign-off names the version they read, so a
   re-extraction invalidates the sign-off instead of quietly inheriting it.
2. **Evidence rather than judgement.** Everything this module computes is derived
   mechanically from the extracted text and is reproducible: which passages are first person,
   which sentences carry a checkable number, which quotations have no attribution nearby.
   None of it is a claim about quality. The editorial fields stay empty until a human fills
   them, the same contract `blog_sources._draft_record` keeps.
3. **It cannot move an article forward.** `analyse()` writes no status, no gate and no
   `sourceReviewedFully`. Only `record_review()` does, it is reachable only from an
   authenticated Admin route, and it refuses unless the reviewer names the analysis version
   they actually read.

## Where the body lives

The evidence can run to tens of kB on a long document - passage text, sentence text, a list
of quotations - so it goes to S3 and the DynamoDB record keeps counts plus the key. Same
reason the extract does: a 400 kB item cap is not much once real prose is involved.

The key is `o/blog-production/source-analysis/<sourceId>/v<n>.json`. That is a directory per
source rather than the flat `source-analysis/<sourceId>.json` the steering file first
described, because versions need distinct keys and an overwrite would destroy the artifact a
reviewer signed against - which is the whole point. The steering layout was updated to match
rather than the code bent to fit a line of documentation.

**The prefix is public and this artifact is not linked.** `o/` is served by CloudFront with
no authentication, so an analysis is fetchable by anyone holding its URL. Unlike a source PDF,
which `blog_sources.source_url` deliberately surfaces so a reviewer can open the document,
nothing here returns a URL for an analysis: the body is proxied through the authenticated
detail route. That is the honest reading of "internal, never public copy" on a public prefix -
unlisted and unlinked, not gated. If it must be genuinely private, the prefix moves under
`secure/` and nothing else in this module changes.
