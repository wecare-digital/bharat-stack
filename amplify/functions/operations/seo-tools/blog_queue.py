"""SQS fan-out for bulk ingestion, and the three things that made a self-chaining sweep wrong.

WHAT THE SWEEP DID, AND WHY IT DOES NOT SCALE.

`blog_sources.run_worker` asks the table for UPLOADED sources, extracts five, and re-invokes
itself if any remain. For fifty documents that is fine. For the stated requirement - thousands in
one go - it has three problems, and only the first is about speed:

1. **It is strictly serial.** One invocation at a time, five documents each, so 2,500 sources is
   500 sequential invocations. The work is embarrassingly parallel and none of it was.
2. **A poison document stops nothing and retries forever.** A PDF that makes pypdf raise is
   marked EXTRACTION_FAILED and skipped, which is correct - but a source that fails for a
   TRANSIENT reason gets no retry at all unless somebody clicks Retry, and a source that fails
   deterministically inside the chain has nowhere to be recorded except its own status field.
3. **Every invocation pays a full sweep.** `pending_sources` filters the whole `blogSource`
   partition server-side AFTER reading it, so the cost of finding the next five documents grows
   with the total number of sources - fastest at the start of a run and slowest at the end.

A queue fixes all three: messages are consumed concurrently, a message that keeps failing lands
in a dead-letter queue instead of disappearing, and a consumer is handed its work rather than
searching for it.

## Why the queue cannot starve the API it shares a function with

`wecare-seo-tools` serves the admin HTTP API AND consumes this queue. Left alone, SQS scales a
consumer up to 1,000 concurrent executions, which would consume the account's concurrency and
make every admin request queue behind document extraction.

`ScalingConfig.MaximumConcurrency` on the event source mapping is the control, set to
`MAX_CONCURRENCY` below. Five concurrent extractions is still five times the old serial rate, and
it leaves the function's concurrency overwhelmingly available to the API. The alternative -
reserving concurrency for the API - would cap the API instead, which is the wrong end.

## At-least-once delivery is safe here, and it is not luck

A standard queue can deliver the same message twice. `blog_sources.process_source` claims a
source with a conditional write on `status = UPLOADED`, so the second delivery loses the race and
returns SKIPPED. That is the same mechanism that made the self-chaining sweep safe when a chained
invocation overlapped its predecessor, and it is why a FIFO queue is not needed - FIFO would add
ordering nobody wants and a 300 messages/second cap for no benefit.

## Partial batch failure, reported per message

With `ReportBatchItemFailures` the consumer returns the identifiers of just the messages that
failed, and only those are retried. Without it, one bad document in a batch of ten redelivers all
ten, so nine already-extracted sources are re-read, lose the claim race, and the batch makes no
progress while looking busy.
