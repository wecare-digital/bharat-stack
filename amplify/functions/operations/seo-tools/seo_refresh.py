"""Scheduled derived-SEO refresh sweep (a content-change detector).

NAME. This module is `seo_refresh` rather than `seo_freshness` deliberately: a separate,
pre-existing `seo_freshness.py` in this package is the Bedrock-cost dedup for the AI SEO-audit
path (its `source_hash`/`decide`/`skip_log`). This one is the scheduled sweep that regenerates
DERIVED SEO records for blog posts whose content changed. Two different jobs, two names.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads the public blog corpus from `wix` (the source of truth, read-only), and for
each post asks `seo_engine.refresh` to recompute the derived SEO record IF its sourceHash
changed. An unchanged post is skipped with zero writes. That is the entire cost story: the job
reads a cached corpus and writes only the records that actually moved.

WHY A SCHEDULED CHECK RATHER THAN AN EVENT. Blog content is authored in Wix, outside this
system, so there is no reliable in-app event to hook. A low-frequency poll that skips unchanged
records (via sourceHash) is the cheap, correct pattern the brief describes, and it never becomes
a constant poller: it runs on an EventBridge schedule (daily by default) and does bounded work.

HOW IT IS INVOKED. Not by a public HTTP route. The handler recognises a scheduler event by its
shape - a top-level `seoFreshness: True` and no `requestContext` - the same IAM-gated,
not-reachable-from-the-API pattern the blog worker uses. An EventBridge Scheduler target invokes
the function with that payload.

COST MODE. In FREE mode the job still runs (it is deterministic and nearly free), but it will
not perform any AI-derived enrichment. The refresh itself is deterministic regardless.
