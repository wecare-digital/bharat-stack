"""Thirteen assertions against the post that actually went live.

WHY VERIFY AT ALL, WHEN THE PUBLISH REPORTED SUCCESS.

Because a successful write is not evidence of a correct post. Wix can accept a draft and publish
something different from what was sent: it appends a numeric suffix to a slug that collides, it
drops rich-content nodes it does not recognise, it silently truncates an excerpt, and a category id
that no longer exists is accepted without error and simply not applied. Every one of those leaves
a live article that a reader sees and no record mentions.

So publication is not the end of the pipeline. Reading the post back and checking it against what
was approved is, and the result is recorded next to the publish record rather than inferred.

## It reads the PUBLIC post, not the authenticated one

`wix.get_blog_post_by_slug` goes through the anonymous visitor token, which is the path that
serves the live site. Two consequences, both deliberate:

  - It proves the article is actually **public**, not merely created. An authenticated read would
    happily return a draft and report success on a post no reader can reach.
  - It works while `WIX_CREDENTIALS_DISABLED` is set, because that switch covers the API key and
    not the visitor token. Verification is a read-only safety check, and an incident control that
    also disabled the ability to check what is live would be the wrong shape.

## A failure is recorded, never silently retried

Thirteen assertions, each named, each reported with what was expected and what was found. A
failing run sets `pipeline.verifyStatus = FAILED` and stops. Retrying would re-read the same post
to reach the same conclusion; the fix is editorial or a republish, and both are operator actions.

The one thing a verification run may do is move a PUBLISHED article to VERIFIED - the last status
in the standard's own list, and the only status transition in this system that is earned by reading
the live site rather than by asserting something about a draft.
