"""The one place an article is assessed, and the one place its gate is resolved.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS AT ALL.

Five different code paths write an `articleStatus`: extraction, an AI proposal, accepting an
edit, recording the source reading, and a QA run. Before this they each called
`blog_quality_v2.assess` directly. That works right up until a rule needs to come from
somewhere the gate cannot see - a per-project content template, or a human's gate sign-off -
at which point the rule applies on whichever call sites somebody remembered to change, and the
ones they missed keep reporting a status computed from fewer rules. The difference is invisible
in the record.

So: every writer of an `articleStatus` goes through `assess_draft`, and
`test_every_assessment_site_routes_through_blog_gate` greps the modules to keep it that way.

## THE GATE IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED

`blog_quality_v2.decide_status` will not return READY_TO_PUBLISH until `record["gate"]` answers
all eleven section 29 human gates. The obvious implementation writes that object onto the draft
when a human signs off - and then the article can be edited afterwards while the gate stays
behind, certifying text nobody approved. The fix would be a revocation step on every write
path, which is the same class of problem as the one above: a cleanup somebody has to remember.

Instead the gate is computed on every assessment from the current sign-off, and only when the
sign-off's recorded body hash still matches the article. Editing one word of the body changes
the hash, so the gate simply is not there any more. There is nothing to revoke and nothing to
forget.

## Why the corpus is off by default

Section 28 duplication needs the 1,165-post sketch index, which is 1.4 MB of JSON. Extraction
assesses five drafts per worker invocation and none of them has an article body yet, so loading
it there costs real time to compare nothing. It is loaded for a QA run, where the comparison is
meaningful and the result is recorded - and `blog_qa` refuses a sign-off against a run that did
not load it, so the release path can never skip it.
