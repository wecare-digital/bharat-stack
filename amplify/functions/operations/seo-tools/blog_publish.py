"""The publish queue. An operator releases; nothing here decides to publish on its own.

THE ONE FAILURE THIS DOMAIN MUST NEVER HAVE.

Publishing the same article twice cannot be undone after the fact. A duplicate post gets indexed,
linked and cited, and deleting it afterwards leaves a dead URL where a real one was. Every
structural decision in this module is about that:

  - A release RESOLVES BEFORE IT GENERATES. A second release of the same source returns the job
    that already exists rather than creating another one.
  - The transition to PUBLISHING is a CONDITIONAL WRITE on `status = QUEUED`, so two concurrent
    publishers cannot both proceed. Same mechanism as the extraction claim.
  - Releasability is re-checked AT PUBLISH TIME, not trusted from release time. An article can be
    edited, or its sign-off revoked, between the two - and the queue is exactly where that gap
    lives.

## Releasing is not publishing, and that separation is the point

`release` records an intent and enqueues nothing. `publish` performs the Wix write. Spec section
38: processing completion must never automatically mean publishing. There is no path from
extraction, the SQS consumer, a QA run or a batch reaching READY to either function - a test
asserts it by grepping, because that is the kind of convenience somebody adds later.

## Wix writes are switched off, and a refusal is recorded rather than swallowed

`WIX_CREDENTIALS_DISABLED=true` is set on this function. `wix._load_api_key` calls
`wix_guard.refuse_if_disabled` before reading the credential, so `publish` reaches the Wix call
and is refused before any request is made. That is recorded on the job as REFUSED with the reason,
which is a different state from FAILED - "the operator has writes switched off" and "Wix rejected
the post" must not look the same on a dashboard.

A REFUSED job stays releasable: it is still QUEUED in intent, and re-running `publish` after the
switch is cleared proceeds. Nothing retries it automatically, because a refusal is a deliberate
operator state and retrying past it would defeat the switch.

## The Ricos compiler is the one that produced the live corpus

`wix_blog_migrate.markdown_to_rich_content` and `draft_post` are imported rather than
reimplemented. A second compiler would drift from the one behind the 1,165 published posts, and
the first symptom would be an article that renders differently from every article beside it.
