"""Do not pay Bedrock twice for the same content.

THE LEAK THIS CLOSES. `_run_audit` called `ai.invoke_seo` unconditionally. Auditing a post,
then auditing it again an hour later with nothing changed, invoked the model a second time and
produced the same answer at the same price. Nothing compared the content first.

The repository already hashes content for exactly this purpose elsewhere -
`blog_pipeline.content_hash`, `blog_gate.body_sha256`, `blog_sources.sourceSha256`,
`blog_publish` - so change detection is an established pattern here and the SEO audit path was
the one place that skipped it.

    audit #1   hash differs (or absent)  ->  call the model, store the hash
    audit #2   hash matches              ->  return the stored audit, ZERO model calls
    audit #3   hash matches              ->  same
    content edited, audit #4             ->  hash differs, call the model

READ ONLY, AND THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT OF HASHING RATHER THAN TIMESTAMPING. The hash is
computed FROM source content and stored on the DERIVED audit record. Source content is never
written, and in particular no `updatedAt` on a page or post is touched - a freshness check that
stamped the thing it checked would corrupt the sitemap's lastmod and make every check look like
an edit.

WHY NOT TRUST `updatedAt` ALONE. It is available on a post, and it is the wrong signal: a CMS
can rewrite it for a tag change, a republish, or a migration, none of which change a word of
what the model would read. A content hash changes when the content changes. It is also the only
option for the page audit path, where there is no body and no reliable timestamp at all.
