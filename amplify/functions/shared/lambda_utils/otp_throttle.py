"""Per-IP and per-phone throttling for the OTP front door, because the trigger cannot do it.

Why this cannot live in the Cognito trigger
-------------------------------------------
`customer-whatsapp-auth` is a `CUSTOM_AUTH` trigger, and **a Cognito trigger event carries no
client IP**. The function's own comment says so, and it is correct — there is no field to read. So
per-IP limiting is structurally impossible there, and the existing per-phone counter only runs on
the `userNotFound` branch, which means a **registered** number has no send limit at all: a caller
can loop `InitiateAuth` and drive unbounded WhatsApp messages to a real handset.

Both web ACLs were deleted on 2026-09-28, so nothing in front of the pool filters by IP either.

The answer is an HTTP front door that sees `requestContext.http.sourceIp` and throttles before it
ever reaches Cognito. That is this module.

Two axes, because either alone is bypassable
--------------------------------------------
- **Per phone** bounds how fast one number can be targeted. Without it, one victim's handset can
  be flooded from a botnet.
- **Per IP** bounds how many *different* numbers one origin can touch. Without it, an attacker
  spreads across numbers and every per-phone counter stays happily under its limit while
  thousands of messages go out.

Neither is sufficient. Both are cheap.

Fail closed, unlike the primitive next door
-------------------------------------------
`lambda_utils/rate_limit.py` fails **open** on error, which is right for a throughput guard: a
DynamoDB blip should not stop legitimate traffic. It is wrong here. This limiter's whole purpose is
to bound a path that spends real money and reaches a real person's phone, so an unreadable counter
means "refuse", not "allow". That is the single most important difference between the two modules,
and the reason this is not just a call into that one.

Rate-limit state must outlive the thing it protects
---------------------------------------------------
The TTL is set from the window, not from the request. If the row expired with the challenge, an
attacker would get a fresh budget every time a code expired, which is precisely the opposite of a
limit.
