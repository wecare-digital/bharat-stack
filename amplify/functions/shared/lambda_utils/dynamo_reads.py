"""Bounded DynamoDB reads. One implementation, no copies.

These began life inside `lambda_utils/agent/governance.py`, written to stop a language
model paginating a whole table on a whim. The problem is not specific to agents:
`messaging/ad-attribution` had the same shape reached from an ordinary HTTP route,
and worse in one respect — it passed **no** `Limit` to DynamoDB at all, so asking for
one item still transferred up to 1 MB per page, and with a `FilterExpression` it
could read the entire table while collecting almost nothing.

So the helpers live here and `agent.governance` re-exports them. A second copy is how
the stage-prefix rule came back twice before it was given a shared home.

The two rules worth stating
---------------------------
**A limit must reach DynamoDB, not just Python.** Slicing after the fact still pays
for and transfers everything. `Limit` bounds what is *examined*, which is what you are
billed for.

**`truncated` is part of the answer.** "50 results" and "at least 50 results" are
different claims, and whatever a caller is handed is what it will repeat to a person
or render as a total.
