"""The internal contract between the WhatsApp ingress and the inbound worker.

What was here before
--------------------
`wecare-whatsapp-calling` verifies Meta's signature on `/whatsapp`, then forwards
non-call events to `wecare-inbound-whatsapp` by `lambda_client.invoke`. It wrapped
them in a *synthetic SNS envelope*:

    {"Records": [{"Sns": {"Message": "{\\"whatsAppWebhookEntry\\": \\"{...}\\"}"}}]}

That shape is a fossil. It dates from an architecture where Meta delivered through
AWS End User Messaging Social into an SNS topic, and it no longer describes
anything: there is no SNS topic subscription to this function in
`amplify/backend.ts`, in `amplify/backend-resources.ts`, or in the live
event-source mappings - the only SNS references left in IaC are CloudWatch alarm
topics. The AWS account has no linked WABA.

It cost three things:

  * The webhook entry was **double JSON-encoded** - a string inside a string
    inside a dict - so every consumer paid two `json.loads` and any logging of the
    envelope was unreadable.
  * It lied about the source. A reader seeing `Records[].Sns` reasonably concludes
    a topic exists and looks for a subscription that was never there. Two
    documents in `docs/meta-whatsapp/` still describe that ingress.
  * It made the boundary untyped. Nothing declared which fields the worker needs,
    so `dlq-replay` stores an `originalRecord` and invokes with it directly,
    never rebuilding this envelope - meaning replay of an inbound failure does
    not reproduce the shape the worker parses.

The contract
------------
`build()` emits a flat, self-describing event. `parse()` accepts it **and** the
legacy envelope, and returns a uniform list of work items either way.

Accepting both is not indecision. The producer and the consumer are separate
Lambdas deployed separately, and the invoke is asynchronous: at the moment the new
producer ships there can be in-flight events carrying the old shape, and
`dlq-replay` may hold stored payloads in it for as long as its DLQ retention. The
legacy arm is therefore load-bearing until both have drained, and `parse()` reports
which shape it saw so that can be measured rather than assumed.
