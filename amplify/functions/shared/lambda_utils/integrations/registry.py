"""Shared registry of outbound data integrations. READ only, by construction.

What this is for
----------------
Eight providers are named in the brief — Google Ads, GA4, Search Console, Business
Profile, Play Reporting, Bing Webmaster, Meta Ads/CTWA and Wix — and before this
module there was no record of which of them we can actually read, under whose
account, with which scopes, or how stale the answer is. Measured 2026-09-23:

    provider            adapter files    credential
    Google Ads              0            wecare/google/ads
    Search Console          0            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Play Reporting          0            NONE
    GA4                     6            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Business Profile        4            wecare/seo/google-oauth
    Bing Webmaster         14            wecare/bing/api
    Meta Ads / CTWA        26            wecare/meta-system-user-token
    Wix                    31            env fallback, no secret

Three of the eight have no adapter, and one of those has no credential either. A
registry that listed all eight as available would be the same class of lie as the
Bedrock agent config that claimed a working agent for five months.

Three decisions this module exists to enforce
---------------------------------------------
**Access is three-state, never a boolean.** A credential existing is not a scope
being granted. That has already cost this project once: the Google OAuth client
exists and works, and `contacts.readonly` was never added to the consent screen, so
the identity import is blocked on a provider setting rather than on code.
`CREDENTIAL_ABSENT` / `SCOPE_UNVERIFIED` / `VERIFIED` keeps the difference visible,
and `VERIFIED` means a real authorised read succeeded and was recorded — nothing
here claims it, because nothing has.

**A read carries its provider request id, or records that it has none.** Without one
there is no support conversation to be had with Google or Meta; "it returned the
wrong number yesterday" is unactionable. Absent is recordable. Fabricated is not.

**Freshness is explicit and comparable.** A cached metric rendered without its age is
how a dashboard shows last week's numbers as today's. Every result carries
`fetched_at` and the provider's own `max_age_seconds`, and staleness is derived.

Read-only by construction. There is no write verb in this module — not a flag, not a
guard, nothing to switch on. It also makes no provider call and never reads a secret
value: existence is established with `DescribeSecret`, because pulling a credential
into the layer that renders a dashboard is how one ends up in a log.
