"""Creating a Razorpay order, and verifying the browser's checkout callback signature.

Where this sits in the website Standard Checkout flow (section 8)

                                   browser opens Razorpay Standard Checkout (hosted modal)

                                             v
                              verify_checkout_signature()  (HMAC on the SERVER-STORED order id)
                                             |  signed success is still only a trigger
                                             v
                              razorpay_verify.verifier_for_event  (authoritative capture readback)

This module is deliberately two small things and nothing more:

* `create_order` — the one server-side `POST /v1/orders`. It is the only place a payable gateway
  order is created for the website path, and it disables partial payment so a customer cannot pay
  a fraction of the reviewed total.
* `verify_checkout_signature` — the HMAC check Razorpay documents for the browser handoff
  (`razorpay_order_id|razorpay_payment_id` keyed with `key_secret`). It is NOT a payment proof:
  it only confirms the browser result was not tampered with. A paid state still requires
  `razorpay_verify`'s authenticated capture readback.

Why a separate module from `razorpay_verify`
--------------------------------------------
`razorpay_verify` answers one question — "did Razorpay capture this?" — and is the only thing that
may assert a payment happened. Creating an order and checking a callback signature are different
operations with different trust: an order-create is a request we make, and a callback signature is
tamper-evidence on data the browser relayed. Keeping them here, as a sibling, keeps
`razorpay_verify` the single authority on capture while reusing the same lazy-secret,
status-only-logging, `RazorpayUnavailable`-on-error posture.

Which secret, and the lazy read
--------------------------------
`wecare/razorpay/api` (`key_id` + `key_secret`). **Not** `wecare/razorpay-webhook`, which holds
only `webhook_secret`. Conflating them has cost this codebase once already (see `razorpay_verify`
and `core/secure-files/razorpay_orders`). `key_id` is publishable — the browser checkout needs it —
and `key_secret` is used only as HTTP basic auth and the HMAC key here and never leaves this module.
The read is lazy, at request time, cached per sandbox, for the SnapStart reason recorded in
`razorpay_verify`: a module-scope read freezes a rotated value until every warm sandbox recycles.

No value is ever logged. Status codes and exception TYPES only; Razorpay's error bodies echo the
request, which carried basic auth, so neither the body nor the signature prefix is logged.

No SDK
------
`razorpay==2.0.1` is in `requirements-dev.txt` only, so it is not in the Lambda runtime. The Orders
API is one POST and the signature is one HMAC; bundling a dependency to make them would be the
larger risk. This mirrors `core/secure-files/razorpay_orders`, which already does the same.
