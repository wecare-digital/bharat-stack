"""Which source may overwrite which Contact field.

The problem this exists to stop
-------------------------------
A Contact's `phone` can arrive from an inbound WhatsApp message, where Meta has told us the
number the message genuinely came from. It can also arrive from a Google contact card,
where it is whatever the *account owner* typed into their address book.

Those are not the same quality of fact. One is a delivery-verified identifier; the other is
a note someone made. A naive sync that writes every field it receives will let a stale
address-book entry overwrite a number we have proof of - and the failure is silent, because
the row still looks perfectly well formed. The next message goes to the wrong person.

So each source carries a **trust level per field**, and a write only lands when the
incoming source is at least as trusted as the one already recorded.

The levels
----------
::

    VERIFIED   4   the provider proved it: a wamid's sender, a Truecaller consent assertion
    DECLARED   3   the customer typed it themselves, in our own Flow
    OPERATOR   2   a human on our side entered it in the dashboard
    IMPORTED   1   a third-party address book or bulk upload
    INFERRED   0   derived by us, e.g. a name guessed from a profile string

`VERIFIED` beats everything and equal beats equal, which matters: a second inbound message
must be able to update a contact's own profile name, or the record freezes at whatever the
first message happened to carry.

Why `phone` is special
----------------------
`phone` is the routing key. Every outbound message resolves to it, and `phone-index` is how
the RCS and WhatsApp readers find a contact at all. An import overwriting it does not just
corrupt a field - it redirects a conversation to a different human being.

So `phone` is additionally protected by `LOCKED_FIELDS`: once recorded at `VERIFIED`, no
later source may change it, not even another `VERIFIED` one. Two verified numbers mean two
people, or a number that genuinely changed - and both of those need a human decision, not a
silent overwrite. `needs_review` is how that decision gets queued.

Why the provenance is stored per field, not per row
---------------------------------------------------
A single contact legitimately mixes sources: the phone is VERIFIED from WhatsApp, the
company name is IMPORTED from Google, the address is DECLARED from a Flow. A row-level
"source: google" would either block the import entirely or let it through wholesale.
