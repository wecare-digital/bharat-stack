"""The registration front door: the only way a walk-up customer comes into existence.

Why a front door is necessary rather than convenient
----------------------------------------------------
The customer Cognito pool is `AllowAdminCreateUserOnly = true`, measured live, and the trigger's
own docstring says why: *customer users are provisioned administratively; public self-sign-up stays
off.* That is deliberate architecture, not a gap. So a checkout customer cannot simply call
`InitiateAuth` and appear — there is nothing to authenticate against until somebody creates them.

The wrong fix is to open self-signup. `SignUp` from a browser lets anyone mint pool users at will,
which is an unauthenticated write to the identity store that everything else trusts.

The right fix is this: an HTTP route that proves the phone by OTP **first**, then provisions the
Cognito user administratively from the backend. The browser never creates anything; it proves
something, and the backend decides what that entitles it to.

Two things only this layer can do
---------------------------------
**It can see the client IP.** A Cognito trigger event carries none — the trigger's comment says so
and it is correct — so per-IP throttling is structurally impossible there. Here
`requestContext.http.sourceIp` exists and cannot be spoofed. With both web ACLs deleted on
2026-09-28, this route is the only place per-IP limiting can live at all.

**It can refuse to leak.** The existing trigger deliberately returns `registered: true/false` as a
considered trade: every recipient is hand-provisioned, so "this number is a customer" is a
low-value disclosure, and hiding it stranded mistyped numbers on a code screen forever. **That
trade does not survive contact with a public checkout.** Once anyone can reach this endpoint,
whether a number is a customer becomes a real secret, and the usability problem it solved is gone
anyway — a walk-up customer who mistypes a digit gets a code at the number they actually typed,
because we create it. So this layer answers identically either way.

Ordering, and why the throttle comes before everything
------------------------------------------------------
Normalise, throttle, *then* send. The throttle is the only step that costs nothing and prevents
something expensive: a WhatsApp message is billable and lands on a real person's handset. Placing
it after the send, or after a customer lookup, means the flood has already happened by the time the
counter notices.
