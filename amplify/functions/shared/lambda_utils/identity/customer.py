"""Customer identity: immutable id, mutable contacts, and the normalisation that guards both.

The rule
--------
**Customer identity is immutable. Phone and email are attributes.** A phone number can be
ported, recycled by a carrier, or simply mistyped and corrected; an email address changes with
a job. Keying a customer on either means that when one changes you either lose the order
history or silently merge two people. So identity is `CUS_<ULID>` and nothing else, and the
phone and email hang off it as verifiable, replaceable fields.

Normalisation is part of the identity contract, not a formatting convenience: uniqueness is
enforced on the *normalised* value, so two spellings of one phone number must collapse to one
string before any conditional write happens. Getting that wrong in either direction is a real
failure - too aggressive and two people share an account, too lax and one person gets two.

Why email normalisation stops at trim and lowercase
---------------------------------------------------
It is tempting to strip dots and `+tags`, because Gmail ignores them. Two reasons not to:

1. **It is only true at Gmail.** The local part is owned by the receiving server, and RFC 5321
   says it may be case sensitive and may treat dots as significant. `a.b@fastmail.com` and
   `ab@fastmail.com` can be different people. Applying Gmail's rules universally merges
   accounts that are not the same account.
2. **It changes what the customer typed.** The address is a delivery target as well as a key,
   and a receipt must go to the address they gave.

Lowercasing the *domain* is unambiguously safe (DNS is case-insensitive). Lowercasing the local
part is technically a mutation, but every provider in practice treats it as insensitive, and not
doing it lets one person register twice by holding shift. That trade is taken deliberately and
is recorded here so it is not re-litigated by accident.

    Use this at every customer-facing phone entry point. `normalize_phone` is retained
    unchanged for its other eight callers, which are fed from already-stored records rather
    than from a browser.

    Why this function exists at all
    -------------------------------
    `normalize_phone` strips every non-digit *before* it looks for a country code, so a
    ten-digit foreign number arrives at `_INDIAN_MOBILE_RE` looking exactly like an Indian
    mobile and `DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE` is prepended to a number that was already complete.
    Measured: `+6591234567` became `+916591234567`, `+6421234567` became `+916421234567`,
    `+9715012345` became `+919715012345`. The OTP then reaches an unrelated Indian
    subscriber, the real customer can never sign in, and because uniqueness is enforced on
    the normalised value the WRONG identity is the one that gets reserved. `src/lib/dialCodes.ts`
    offers +65, so this is a shipped path, not a hypothetical.

    Why a wrapper around `normalize_phone` cannot work
    --------------------------------------------------
    A wrapper that calls `normalize_phone` and inspects the result is structurally unable to
    fix this: by the time it sees `+916591234567` the `+65` is gone, and `+6591234567` is
    indistinguishable from a genuine Indian `6591234567` that the legacy function was right
    to prefix. The country-code decision has to be made on the ORIGINAL text, before any
    `re.sub(r"\\D", "", ...)`. That is why the branch below runs on `compact`, which keeps the
    `+` and the `00`, and why the digit strip happens only afterwards. A test monkeypatches
    `normalize_phone` to a tripwire to keep a future refactor from quietly re-introducing the
    delegation.

    No country code is a REJECTION, not a default
    ---------------------------------------------
    Input carrying neither `+` nor `00` raises `MissingCountryCode`. Three reasons:

    1. The owner handoff (section 6) asks for bare national digits to be refused at the
       customer entry point rather than guessed at.
    2. `src/components/PhoneField.tsx` always emits a dial code from `DIAL_CODES`, so no real
       UI state produces a bare national number - only a direct API caller does.
    3. The customer-visible copy for this state already exists:
       `src/lib/signInMessages.ts::MISSING_CODE`.

    Defaulting instead was rejected: it leaves the +91 inference live for any non-PhoneField
    caller at a customer entry point, which is the defect wearing a wrapper.

    `00` is read as the international prefix, always
    -----------------------------------------------
    Per E.123/E.164, `00` introduces a country code even when what follows happens to look
    like a bare Indian mobile. So `009330994400` yields `+9330994400` - country code 93 - and
    NOT `+919330994400`. This is a deliberate divergence from `normalize_phone`'s lenient
    reading and is pinned by a test, because reading `00` as "maybe a country code, maybe not"
    is precisely the ambiguity that produced the defect above.

    Trunk-zero handling is India-only, and the consequence is accepted
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    A single trunk `0` is stripped only when the country code is `91`, because that is the one
    national dialling convention this business knows. Every other country gets none, since
    inventing a trunk rule per country is the same guess-what-they-meant mistake in a new
    coat. The documented consequence: `+44 07911 123456` yields `+4407911123456`, which the
    provider rejects. That is a visible failure the customer can correct, not a silent
    misdelivery to a stranger - which is the trade being made on purpose.
