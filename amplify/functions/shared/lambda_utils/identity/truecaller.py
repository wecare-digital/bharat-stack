"""Truecaller consent verification: nonce lifecycle, endpoint allowlist, profile mapping.

The contract, from Truecaller's mobile-web documentation
-------------------------------------------------------
1. We mint a `requestNonce` (8-64 characters) and open a deep link::

       truecallersdk://truesdk/web_verify?requestNonce=...&partnerKey=<app_key>
           &partnerName=<app_name>&lang=en&...

2. The user consents in the Truecaller app.
3. Truecaller **POSTs to our callback URL**::

       {"requestId": "...", "accessToken": "...",
        "endpoint": "https://profile4-noneu.truecaller.com/v1/default"}

   or, on refusal::

       {"requestId": "...", "status": "user_rejected"}

4. We GET that endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and receive the profile:
   `phoneNumbers`, `name.first/last`, `onlineIdentities.email`, `badges`, and so on.

The security property that drives this module
---------------------------------------------
**Step 3 hands us the URL we are about to trust, and step 4 believes it.**

The callback is a public, unauthenticated endpoint - it has to be, because Truecaller calls
it. So `endpoint` is attacker-controlled input. Point it at a host under the attacker's
control, return `{"phoneNumbers": ["919999999999"]}`, and we record that number as
*verified for the current user*. That is a complete authentication bypass wearing the costume
of a feature, and it is simultaneously an SSRF into whatever the Lambda can reach - including
the VPC and the instance metadata service.

`resolve_profile_endpoint` therefore refuses any host outside `ALLOWED_PROFILE_HOSTS`,
requires HTTPS, and rejects embedded credentials, ports and redirect-looking paths. The
allowlist is the control; the `Bearer` token is not, because the attacker supplies that too.

The second property: no bulk lookup
-----------------------------------
The brief requires consent-based verification of the **current user** only. The structural
guarantee is that a profile fetch is reachable only with an access token Truecaller minted
against a nonce **we** issued, and `claim_nonce` binds the nonce to the session that asked
for it - so the flow cannot verify a third party's number either, only the person holding the
handset.

There is deliberately no function here that takes a phone number and asks Truecaller who owns
it. That API exists; we do not call it, and `tests/test_identity.py` asserts the absence.

Nonce rules
-----------
* Minted by us from a CSPRNG, never sequential - it is the only correlation the public
  callback has.
* Single use. `claim_nonce` is a state transition, so a replayed callback cannot re-verify.
* Expiring. A consent dialog the user abandons must not leave a nonce claimable next week.
* Bound to a session. Otherwise user A completes a flow and the result lands on user B.
