"""OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE, and the token lifecycle.

Pure: builds URLs, verifies parameters, and decides when a token needs refreshing. The HTTP
calls live in the Lambda so these decisions stay testable without credentials - which
matters here because the live consent screen is owner-gated.

The five things that go wrong in this flow
------------------------------------------
Each of these is a real, common failure rather than a theoretical one, and each is handled
explicitly below.

**1. `expires_in` is relative, and gets stored as if it were absolute.** Google returns
``"expires_in": 3599``. Persist that number and the token looks fresh forever, because
3599 is always greater than "now" under a naive comparison. `token_record` converts it to
an absolute `expiresAt` at the moment of exchange, which is the only point where the
relative value means anything.

**2. The refresh token arrives once and then never again.** Google issues
`refresh_token` only on the first consent for a client/user pair, unless you explicitly ask
again with `access_type=offline` **and** `prompt=consent`. A re-authorisation therefore
returns a token response with no `refresh_token` - and code that stores the response
wholesale wipes the one it already had, converting a working long-lived integration into one
that dies at the next expiry. `merge_token_record` never overwrites a stored refresh token
with an absent one.

**3. Refreshing exactly at expiry.** A token that expires in 5 seconds passes an
`expiresAt > now` check and then fails mid-request, and clock skew between us and Google
makes the window wider than it looks. `needs_refresh` applies a skew so the refresh happens
before the cliff.

**4. `state` is generated but never actually checked, or checked but reusable.** Either way
the CSRF protection is decorative. `state` here is a random token the caller must store
against the session and consume exactly once; `verify_state` does a constant-time compare
and the store is responsible for single use.

**5. The user silently grants fewer scopes than asked for.** Google's consent screen lets
a user deselect individual scopes. The token that comes back is valid, so nothing looks
wrong - but `people.connections.list` then returns 403 and the sync appears to find no
contacts. `missing_scopes` compares granted against required at exchange time, so the
failure is legible at the point of consent rather than as an empty sync days later.

Why S256 only
-------------
`plain` is still in RFC 7636 and is never acceptable here: it sends the verifier itself as
the challenge, so an attacker who can read the authorization request can complete the
exchange. `build_authorization_url` hard-codes S256 and `CHALLENGE_METHOD` is not a
parameter, so there is no way to weaken it from a call site.
