"""Deterministic CRM identifiers. Two kinds of duplicate, two different mechanisms.

The distinction this module exists to keep
------------------------------------------
**Technical duplicate.** The same Flow webhook delivered twice. Meta retries, SQS
redrives, a Lambda times out after writing. There is exactly one real enquiry and any
second row is corruption. Defence: a deterministic `leadId` derived from the source and
its reference, so the second write is the *same row* and a conditional put rejects it.

**Business duplicate.** The same person enquiring twice in a week about two different
things. Two real enquiries. Collapsing them loses one, and the sales team never learns
about the second product.

These get confused constantly, in both directions, and both directions are damaging: a
hash over the phone number alone silently discards genuine second enquiries, while a
random uuid per webhook delivery fills the funnel with replay noise that inflates every
conversion denominator.

So `lead_id` is keyed on **(source, source reference)** - what arrived - and never on
the person. Person-level grouping is a *query* (`open_lead_index_key`), answered at read
time from the phone-number index, where a human or a policy can decide. It is not
baked into the identity of the row.

Why a hash and not a compound string key
----------------------------------------
A source reference can be a Meta `flow_token`, a Razorpay order id, a `wamid`, or a click
id - arbitrary length, arbitrary characters, and in the WhatsApp case it can embed a phone
number. A hash gives a fixed-width opaque id that is safe to log and safe to put in a URL,
and it cannot accidentally disclose a customer identifier through a lead id appearing in
a browser address bar or an access log.

SHA-256 truncated to 32 hex characters (128 bits). Not for cryptographic strength - these
are not secrets - but so that the collision probability across any plausible volume is
irrelevant. At 10 million leads the chance of any collision is on the order of 1e-24.

The namespace prefix is not decoration
--------------------------------------
`lead_`, `opp_`, `act_`, `pl_`, `stg_` prefixes make a mis-wired id obvious at the point
of failure rather than three tables later. An `opp_` value passed where a `lead_` belongs
fails a cheap assertion instead of silently querying for a row that cannot exist and
returning "not found", which is indistinguishable from a legitimately absent lead.
