"""What the AI action group is allowed to do, and what it is refused.

Why this module exists
---------------------
`ai/agent-action-group` exposed twelve tools to a Bedrock agent, and eight of them
were things a language model should not be able to choose on its own:

  * SEND - `sendWhatsApp`, `sendSms`, `sendEmail` invoked `wecare-outbound-*`
    with a phone number and a body. No plan, no approval, no receipt. The model's
    tool choice was the authorisation, and the result was a real message to a real
    customer under our registered sender.
  * SCAN - `searchContacts` paginated the whole ContactsTable to exhaustion and
    then filtered in Python. `getStats` did three exhaustive scans. `getMessages`
    scanned both message tables. Every one of those was a `while True` on
    `LastEvaluatedKey`, billed per read, triggered by a model's whim.
  * DELETE - `deleteMessage` hard-deleted from the message store; `deleteContact`
    wrote a `deletedAt` marker.
  * FABRICATE - `createInvoice` returned `{'success': True, 'invoiceId':
    'INV-xxxxxxxx'}` and wrote nothing whatsoever.

The last one is the worst of the four and explains the shape of everything here. A
confident success that did not happen is more damaging than an error, because the
agent repeats it to a person, who then waits for an invoice that does not exist.

So: READ and status tools are enabled. Every APPLY tool is refused
**structurally**. There is deliberately no flag, because the approval, plan-hash
and receipt machinery that would make an APPLY safe does not exist yet - a flag
added now would be a switch nobody could safely throw, and the first person to
find it would throw it.

Three bugs were hiding inside the removed powers
------------------------------------------------
Worth recording, because each is invisible until you look at the power itself:

  * `_delete_message` wrapped the inbound delete in `try/except: pass` then
    deleted from outbound. DynamoDB's `delete_item` SUCCEEDS on a key that does
    not exist, so the inbound attempt never raised, the outbound branch was
    unreachable, and the function reported "deleted successfully" for any id -
    including one that never existed.
  * `_delete_contact` used `update_item ... SET deletedAt` with no existence
    check. DynamoDB upserts, so an unknown id CREATED a row holding nothing but
    `{id, deletedAt}`. A delete that manufactured records.
  * `_find_contact_by_phone` scanned with `contains(phone, last10)` and `Limit=1`.
    `Limit` applies BEFORE the FilterExpression, so it examined one arbitrary item
    and filtered it away, normally finding nobody; and `contains` is a substring
    match, so a hit could be the wrong person. ContactsTable has a `phone-index`
    GSI with an ALL projection, so the scan was never needed - `query_index`
    replaces it with an exact lookup.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The dashboard chat surface: /ai/generate, context='internal-admin'
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Added 2026-09-23, and this is the half that mattered.
#
# Phase 6.1 removed eight ungoverned powers from the Bedrock action group - a
# surface that cannot currently be reached at all, because agent 4UUQYFWX64 is
# NOT_PREPARED. Meanwhile the surface every operator actually uses, `/ai/generate`
# with `context: 'internal-admin'`, ran a 30-tool Bedrock Converse loop whose
# `_execute_internal_tool` dispatched straight to live sends and hard deletes:
# `send_whatsapp_pay`, `make_voice_call`, `delete_messages`, `delete_media_files`
# and `clear_all_contact_data` among them. Three UIs are wired to it
# (FloatingAgent, InternalChatTab, the dashboard AI tab).
#
# Its system prompt did not merely permit that, it pushed for it:
#     "ALWAYS use your tools to execute tasks. Never explain how to do something
#      manually." / "Be proactive: 'send message to Jignesh' -> search first, then
#      send." / "For payment requests, use send_whatsapp_pay tool directly."
#
# The only guard anywhere was a substring match in FloatingAgent against the text
# the USER typed - `['delete all', 'clear all', ...]` - evaluated before the model
# had chosen anything, so "tidy up Asha's records" reached `clear_all_contact_data`
# without a prompt. InternalChatTab had no guard at all, and its 30 tool checkboxes
# were display-only: the toggles were never included in the request body.
#
# So the same policy now covers both surfaces. 12 READ, 18 APPLY.
