"""The gift-card settlement stage, and the two-leg definition of "fully paid".

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/gift-cards-service-plugin-20261001.md`
sections 3.1 (the ladder), 3.2 (`is_fully_settled`), 3.3 (ordering) and 7.3 (the public surface).

Why a second ladder exists at all
---------------------------------
A gift card settles a leg that is NOT a Razorpay capture. The existing verification machinery - the
authoritative Razorpay captured-payment readback, `razorpay_verify`, and the `PROVIDERPAYMENT#`
one-time claim in `order_keys` - can only verify a Razorpay capture, and it is left completely
untouched here. The gift-card leg gets its own forward-only stage, its own evidence and its own
idempotency claim.

Constructed exactly like `payment_status`
-----------------------------------------
String stage VALUES and a SEPARATE `STAGE_RANK` map, mirroring `payment_status`'s `CAPTURED =
"captured"` plus `STATUS_RANK` read through `rank()`. The reason is a measured defect class, not
style: revision 2 of the design presented the ladder as `GC_REDEEMED  50` - a name bound to an int -
and then wrote `stage(attempt) != GC_REDEEMED`, comparing a string against an integer. That is
silently always-true.

`GC_UNKNOWN` is deliberately ABSENT from `STAGE_RANK`, so `stage_rank` returns 0 for it through the
`.get` default - the same construction and the same reason as `payment_status.rank`'s "0 for
unknown, missing, or `none`". An unknown stage can overwrite nothing, which is what makes a
forward-only ladder safe across a deploy that adds a stage.

`GC_VOIDED` (60) OUTRANKS `GC_REDEEMED` (50), for exactly the reason `payment_status` ranks
`refunded` (60) above `captured` (50): a void strictly follows a redemption, so a replayed or late
redeem must not un-void a card. The reverse ranking is how a customer's balance silently disappears.

`GC_HELD` (20) sits below `GC_REDEEMED` and carries NO evidence, deliberately - the same judgement
that puts `authorized` (30) below `captured` (50). A hold is a reservation, not a receipt. Treating
one as settlement is how an order gets marked paid against money that was never deducted.

The persisted attribute holds the RANK, never the name, so the guard is a single numeric comparison
inside DynamoDB. The name is derived from it, which is why the two never both appear in one
expression.

This module writes NOTHING of the Razorpay leg
----------------------------------------------
It reads that leg only through `payment_attempt.may_create_order` and through the two module
constants below, and it never references `record_paid`, `PROVIDERPAYMENT#`,
`payment_attempt.transition` or `razorpay_verify`. `tests/test_gift_card_two_leg_finalization.py`
asserts that by AST rather than trusting it. No decision here compares a raw `'captured'`.
