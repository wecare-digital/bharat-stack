"""Bridge: this application's owned customer address -> the Wix Cart V2 address shape.

WHY A BRIDGE AND NOT A PASSTHROUGH
----------------------------------
This is a headless architecture. The customer, the authentication, the profile and the
address all belong to us; Wix is a catalogue and a price engine reached over HTTP. So the
address that reaches Cart V2 is OUR data, converted at the boundary -- nothing here adds a
field to a Wix-hosted checkout page, and no customer is ever routed to a Wix payment surface.

`lambda_utils.identity.address` is the owned shape (`addressLine1`, `city`, `state`,
`postalCode`, `countryCode`, ...). Wix uses different names and, critically, a different
*type* for the one field that decides tax.

THE FIELD THAT DECIDES TAX, AND WHY THIS MODULE REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wix's `subdivision` is an ISO 3166-2 code (`IN-WB`), not a name (`West Bengal`). In India the
delivery address IS the place of supply: it decides whether a supply is intra-state
(CGST + SGST) or inter-state (IGST). Seller GSTIN `19AAFFW7196L1Z8` is state code 19, West
Bengal -- see `checkout_pricing.SELLER_GSTIN`.

So a wrong or missing subdivision does not produce an error. It produces a *plausible total
with the wrong tax split*, on an invoice carrying a real GSTIN, and that total is what gets
charged. That is strictly worse than a failed checkout, which is why there is no default
subdivision, no "unknown state" fallback and no partial address: `to_wix_address` either
produces a complete, resolvable address or raises.

The India table below is therefore an exact lookup, not a fuzzy match. A state this table does
not recognise is a refusal that names the value, so the fix is to add the mapping rather than
to let an unrecognised state through with the tax quietly wrong.
