"""Turning a verified payment into exactly one order. The step the payment path never had.

What this replaces
------------------
Nothing. That is the point. Measured across the tree, the WhatsApp/Razorpay payment path creates
payment records, invoice state, GST invoices and notifications — but **no commerce order**. So this
is a new capability rather than a refactor, and `PaymentsTable`, `InvoicesTable` and `OrderTable`
all held zero rows when it was written, so there is nothing to migrate.

The ordered pipeline, and why the order is the design
-----------------------------------------------------
1. **Verify with the provider.** A webhook is a trigger, never proof. `razorpay-webhook` currently
   trusts the webhook body on `payment.captured`; the correct pattern already exists in
   `secure-files._confirm_with_razorpay` + `razorpay_orders.order_is_paid`, whose docstring records
   *why*: the webhook signing secret is in this repository's public git history, so a valid
   signature proves only that someone read the history. Razorpay's own API is the only thing that
   can say money moved.
2. **Compare currency, then amount, then customer.** Currency first because it is a single
   equality and a mismatch makes the amount comparison meaningless. Integer paise throughout — a
   one-paise difference fails closed, and `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` in binary floating point, so a float
   anywhere here would refuse legitimate orders.
3. **Claim the right to create.** `PROVIDERPAYMENT#<txn>` before `PAYMENTATTEMPT#<id>`, both
   conditional. This is what makes a duplicate webhook, a concurrent worker and a staff retry
   converge on one order.
4. **Reserve the public order number** — only the claim winner does, so a loser never burns one.
5. **Record it on the claim**, so a crash between 4 and 5 is recoverable on re-entry.

Steps 3-5 live in `order_keys`. This module is the ordering and the comparisons.

What it deliberately does not do
--------------------------------
It does not create the Wix order, record the Wix transaction, generate the receipt or send the
confirmation. Those are separate, individually guarded side effects, and folding them in here would
mean a failure in the fifth one re-runs the first. This function's single job is: *may an order
exist, and if so under which identifiers*. Everything downstream keys off the claim it returns and
can be retried independently.

Failure after capture is never the customer's problem
-----------------------------------------------------
Once Razorpay says captured, the money is ours and the order must not be lost. Every failure past
that point returns a recoverable outcome rather than raising past the caller, and none of them may
produce a message telling the customer to pay again.
