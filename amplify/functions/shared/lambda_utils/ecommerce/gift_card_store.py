"""The gift-card liability ledger. A balance we OWE, keyed on an HMAC of bearer value.

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/gift-cards-service-plugin-20261001.md`
sections 3.4 (idempotency), 4.1 (the split and the cap), 6 (data model), 7.4 (error handling) and
7.5 (validation).

The code is BEARER VALUE, so it is never the key
------------------------------------------------
    giftCardKey = "GIFTCARD#" + HMAC-SHA256(pepper, NFKC(code).upper()).hexdigest()

An HMAC with a pepper, not a bare SHA-256, and the reason is the measured contract: the SPI bounds
a code at `minLength 8, maxLength 20`. An 8-character code over a small alphabet is inside
brute-force range for a plain hash, so a leaked table would expose live balances. The pepper lives
in Secrets Manager (`wecare/wix/giftcard-spi` -> `code_pepper`), is referenced by secret id, and is
read LAZILY at request time through an INJECTED reader - never at module scope, because a
module-scope read is cached for the life of the execution environment and a rotation would not take
effect until every warm sandbox recycled.

This is the deliberate OPPOSITE of `coupon_store`, where the code *is* the partition key because a
coupon code is broadcast marketing material. `tests/test_gift_card_store.py` and
`tests/test_coupon_logging_and_vocabulary.py` pin the asymmetry from both sides so neither gets
"harmonised" into the other.

Logs carry `codeLast4` only, rendered `****1234` by `masked()`. The code never appears in full - not
in a log, not in an exception message, not in a URL. Correlation uses `giftCardId` (ours, a UUIDv7),
`paymentAttemptId` (ours, a UUIDv7) and the SPI's `metadata.requestId`, all of which are loggable.

Every balance move is a CONDITIONAL WRITE
-----------------------------------------
    ADD balancePaise :neg      under      ConditionExpression balancePaise >= :amount

A read-then-write would let two concurrent redemptions both pass a `balance >= amount` check and
overdraw the card. The `GCORDER#<codeHash>#<paymentAttemptId>` claim is a conditional put written
BEFORE the decrement, so a replay loses the put, reads the winning row and returns that same
`transactionId` with the balance untouched.

The claim row carries `settled`. It is written unsettled, then marked settled by the decrement, and
that ordering is what makes an insufficient-balance failure RECOVERABLE: a retry finds an unsettled
claim and re-attempts the decrement rather than reporting a redemption that never moved money.
Nothing here deletes a claim, a transaction, a card or a pointer row - only a `GCHOLD#` audit row.

The void path carries the SAME device under a different name, deliberately rather than a second
mechanism: the `voidedBy` latch is written `credited: False` and only the credit sets it true, so a
throttled credit leaves a void a retry can COMPLETE instead of a customer's balance stranded behind
a permanent `AlreadyVoided` with no operator path back. Both strands of the ledger therefore fail
and recover identically, which is the same reason payment status lives behind one module rather
than being compared string by string in each handler.

A recoverable move must also be a move that cannot happen twice, and a flag on a SECOND item
cannot supply that on its own. `settled` is on the claim row and `credited` is on the transaction
row, so both used to be written after the money had already moved. Failing just that second write
left a state - unsettled claim, or `credited: False` - that a retry could not distinguish from
"the move never ran", and re-driving on the strength of that read debited or credited the card a
second time.

So each money move and the flag that records it are **one `TransactWriteItems` with two `Update`
items**:

    redeem   card:  ADD balancePaise :neg   under  balancePaise >= :amount AND #status = :active
             claim: SET settled = :true     under  settled = :false

    void     card:  ADD balancePaise :amount  under  balancePaise <= :ceiling
             txn:   SET credited = :true      under  attribute_exists(credited) AND credited = :false

One commit, so the balance and the record of having moved it cannot diverge no matter where a
process dies, and no interleaving exists in which the money has moved and the flag has not. The
flags remain what make the recovery REACHABLE; the transaction is what makes it SAFE. There are
no applied-move markers any more and nothing to clean up, so a card row's size is bounded by
construction rather than by a best-effort delete.

Every access is an exact-key operation
--------------------------------------
`get_item` / `put_item` / `update_item` on a fully specified partition key, plus the staff
`status-index` `Query`. No `scan`, no prefix query, no second index. DECISION 5 is what makes that
possible: the existence of a hold or a claim is an ATTRIBUTE of the card row
(`activeHoldAttemptId` / `activeClaimAttemptId`), so the `/v1/redeem` refusal is one `GetItem`
rather than a search. A decision that gates money cannot be made from a scan, and it cannot be made
from a GSI either - a GSI is eventually consistent.

No float, and the ceiling is the SPI's
--------------------------------------
Money is integer paise. The value ceiling is `99_999_999_999` paise (== `999999999.99`, the SPI's
documented `maximum`), asserted on issuance AND on every credit - a balance we cannot report to Wix
is a balance we cannot honour. `money.py`'s `9007199254740991` remains the outer type bound;
the binding constraint is the SPI's.

TTL is disabled on this table and that is stronger than a convention. A gift-card row is a
liability. An expiring row is a disappearing debt. `expiresAtMs` changes what is PERMITTED; it never
removes what is OWED.

    ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: claim, then ONE TRANSACTION that moves the balance and settles the
    claim together, then the ledger records.

    1. `GCORDER#<codeHash>#<paymentAttemptId>` is a conditional put with
       `attribute_not_exists(giftCardKey)`, written BEFORE the balance moves and carrying the
       `transactionId` of the redemption that won. A replay loses the put, reads the winning row
       and returns that same `transactionId` with the balance untouched.
    2. The balance move and the claim's `settled` flag are **two `Update` items in one
       `TransactWriteItems`**: the card under `balancePaise >= :amount AND #status = :active`,
       the claim under `settled = :false`. A read-then-write would let two concurrent
       redemptions both pass a `balance >= amount` check and overdraw the card; two separate
       writes would leave a window in which the money has moved and the claim is unsettled, and
       a retry arriving in that window used to debit the card a second time for one
       `paymentAttemptId`.

    `settled = :false` IS the idempotency guard, and it now commits with the money. A racing
    second redemption fails that condition, the whole transaction is cancelled, nothing moves,
    and it takes the replay branch. The guarantee no longer depends on any marker's lifetime, so
    there is no `appliedClaim#` and nothing to clean up.

    The ordinary duplicate is answered EARLIER and more cheaply, by the pre-read: the conditional
    claim put loses, the existing claim is read, and a `settled` claim returns the replay answer
    with no transaction opened at all. The transaction's conditions are the CONCURRENCY
    RE-CHECK, not the primary decision.

    INVARIANT, because this figure is customer-visible - the SPI emits it as
    `remainingBalance`, which is what Wix shows and settles against:

        `remainingBalancePaise` and `GCTXN#.balanceAfterPaise` are the card's balance **as at
        the read that followed the commit**, which may already include a later interleaved move.
        They are observations, not the result of this transaction. `TransactWriteItems` returns
        no `ALL_NEW`, so an exact post-this-transaction figure is not obtainable. The figure
        that IS exact is `amountPaise`, and the authoritative balance is always a fresh
        consistent read of the card row.

    `source` records whether this was ours or a Wix `/v1/redeem`. Section 1.3 predicts `WIX_SPI`
    never appears, so its appearance is the detector for that prediction being wrong, and
    `wecare-gift-card-wix-spi-redemption` alarms on a single occurrence.

    `sleep` is injected for the bounded retry inside `_transact_with_retry`, exactly as `clock`
    is injected, so the covering test runs at full speed. No production caller passes it.

    genuinely different purchase of the same card SHOULD deduct again, and the claim row is what
    makes a REPLAY idempotent. The `AlreadyRedeemed` refusal is a different rule with a
    different owner - it applies only to a WIX-originated `/v1/redeem`, is decided in the SPI
    handler through `reserved_by`, and exists because our `paymentAttemptId` and Wix's `orderId`
    are not comparable. Folding it in here would make a customer's second purchase refuse.

    `activeHoldAttemptId` is set through `if_not_exists` so a Wix-originated redemption with no
    prior hold still leaves the card reading as spoken-for to the NEXT `/v1/redeem` - which is
    what makes that refusal a single `GetItem` rather than a prefix query.

    The claim item's `settled = :false` is the money's idempotency guard, and it commits in the
    same transaction as the balance. `balancePaise >= :amount` stops an OVERDRAW; `settled =
    :false` stops a SECOND DEDUCTION for one `paymentAttemptId`. Before they were one
    transaction the second guard lived on a second item, so it could only be written after the
    money had already moved, and a retry arriving in that window debited twice.

    `TransactWriteItems` is a CLIENT operation, so this is the real boto3 shape:
    AttributeValue-typed maps through `_marshal`, with `TableName=table.name`. There is no
    fake-shaped branch - the test fake supplies `.name` and `.meta.client`.

    `VoidRequest` carries no `code`, so this walks `GCTXNID#<transactionId>` to the card and - per
    DECISION 9 - to the payment attempt, which is what lets the SPI write `GC_VOIDED` through
    `advance()` rather than having no attempt id to write against.

    The `voidedBy` guard is written BEFORE the credit, for the same reason the claim precedes the
    decrement: if the credit went first and the guard then lost its race, the card would be
    credited twice.

    The guard carries `credited`, and that is what makes the ordering SURVIVABLE as well as safe.
    It is the same device `redeem` uses with the claim row's `settled`: the guard is latched
    `credited = False` and only the credit marks it `True`, so a credit that fails - a throttle
    surfacing as `GiftCardStoreUnavailable`, or a top-up between the redemption and the void
    pushing the return over the SPI ceiling - leaves a void a retry can COMPLETE. Without the
    flag, every retry read the latched `voidedBy` and refused, so the redemption stayed marked
    voided with the balance never returned and no way to return it.

    A retry re-drives the credit under the SAME `void_id`, read back off the latch, so it cannot
    mint a second void transaction. `credited` ABSENT is treated as complete rather than as
    pending: a latch written before this flag existed cannot be distinguished from one whose
    credit landed, and re-driving a credit that already happened would hand the balance back
    twice. Only an explicit `False` - which only this function writes - re-drives.

    And the re-drive is safe to take at face value because the credit and the `credited` flag
    commit in ONE `TransactWriteItems` (`_commit_void`), under `credited = :false`. The flag
    alone is sound in one direction only - it can never claim a credit landed when it did not -
    so `credited: False` used to cover both "the credit never ran" and "the credit ran and this
    write failed", and a retry on the strength of that read handed the balance back twice. With
    both in one transaction there is no second state to distinguish: either the money came back
    and the flag is `True`, or neither happened.

    The ordinary duplicate is answered by the PRE-READ below, with no transaction opened - one
    condition cheaper than opening a conditional transaction only to cancel it. The
    transaction's conditions are the concurrency re-check for a second `void()` that commits
    between this one's pre-read and its transaction.
