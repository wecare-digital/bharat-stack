"""The single entry point producers call. One dispatch owner, by construction.

    handle_connected_call(params_or_event) -> dict

Everything a producer needs is behind this one function, and the only way to reach
it with a Plivo callback is through the adapter in ``events.py``. That is what makes
"exactly one dispatch owner" a property of the code rather than a rule somebody has
to remember: a handler cannot invent a trigger, cannot choose a recipient, and
cannot skip the claim, because it never touches any of those steps.

Order of operations, and why this order
---------------------------------------
::

    1. verify the provider signature        caller's job, before reaching here
    2. normalize + validate the trigger     events.py, fail closed
    3. suppression / watermark check        suppression.py, fail closed
    4. feature flag                          here, default OFF
    5. decide eligibility per channel        policy.py
    6. claim the call + publish the jobs     store.py, ONE transaction
    7. return; workers do the sending

Step 3 precedes step 6 so a suppressed call leaves no rows behind. Step 4 precedes
step 6 for the same reason: with the flag off nothing is written at all, so the
tables describe what the domain really did rather than what it would have done.

Step 6 being one transaction is the whole exactly-once story. The retired design
claimed, then dispatched, and if the process died between the two the claim survived
as a permanent ``PENDING`` that nothing owned - a notification silently lost, with
the provider's redelivery finding the claim taken and doing nothing. Here the claim
and the job are written together or not at all.

Nothing is sent from this call path
-----------------------------------
`handle_connected_call` publishes work and returns. No provider is contacted inside
the webhook, which matters for two reasons: a synchronous send adds provider latency
to the callback the provider is timing, and a timeout mid-send is the one case where
the claim cannot record what happened. The old RCS path had exactly that problem and
"solved" it by never sending at all.
