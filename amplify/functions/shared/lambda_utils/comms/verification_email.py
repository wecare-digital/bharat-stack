"""The email verification code, over SESv2, in WECARE.DIGITAL's own design language.

Why not the existing sender
---------------------------
`messaging/outbound-email` is SES **v1** (`boto3.client('ses')`, `send_email`) with `FROM_EMAIL`
defaulting to `noreply@wecare.digital`, and there is **no `ConfigurationSetName` anywhere** in
`amplify/`, `src/` or `packages/`. A configuration set named `wecare-digital` does exist on the
account - measured live - it was simply never wired up. Without it there is no per-message event
stream, so a bounce or a complaint on a verification email is invisible. That is the one message
where "did it arrive" is the entire question, because a customer who never receives the code
cannot complete checkout and has no way to tell us.

So this uses SESv2 with the configuration set attached, from `one@wecare.digital` - a verified
identity with DKIM `SUCCESS`, measured live, and already the invoice engine's sender.

Under `p=reject` this has to be right first time
------------------------------------------------
`wecare.digital` publishes DMARC `p=reject; sp=reject` and MTA-STS `mode: enforce`. Both are
fail-closed: an unaligned message is **hard-bounced**, not filed as spam. There is no soft
landing to notice a mistake in. That is why the sender is a verified identity with DKIM already
succeeding and why this module does not accept a caller-supplied From address.

Why the HTML is assembled here with literal colours
---------------------------------------------------
Email clients do not reliably support CSS custom properties, external stylesheets, or even
`<style>` blocks - Gmail strips `<style>` in some contexts and Outlook renders with Word's
engine. So the page's tokens cannot be *referenced*; they have to be resolved to literals and
written into `style` attributes.

That creates a drift risk, and this repo has already paid for that once: `design-tokens.ts` said
`#111827` while `tokens.css` said `#1a1a1a`, so primary text resolved to a retired blue-tinted
grey in 14 files and to the right colour everywhere else, decided by which system a component
happened to read. `scripts/check_design_drift.py` exists because of it. The literals below are
therefore named constants, and a test asserts each one against `src/styles/tokens.css` so this
module cannot quietly become the next disagreeing copy.

What this email must never contain
----------------------------------
No order data, no payment data, no internal identifier, no session token, and **no link**. A
"click here to verify" URL is a phishing template, and it would also break the property that the
code only works in the tab that requested it. The code is the only secret carried, it is inert
without that session, and it is never logged - not the value, not a hash of it, not a boolean
derived from one. CodeQL tracks taint across function boundaries and has failed this repo's
build twice over a ternary on a secret's truthiness.
