"""A backend-owned customer session: an opaque id in a cookie, the Cognito tokens kept server-side.

Why this exists, and why not sessionStorage
--------------------------------------------
`src/lib/customerAuth.ts` puts the Cognito **access token** in `sessionStorage` and nothing else.
That has one visible symptom and one invisible one. The visible symptom is that a shopper who closes
the tab, or whose 60-minute access token expires mid-journey, is sent back through WhatsApp OTP -
because sessionStorage dies with the tab and there is no refresh token to renew with. The invisible
one is that the token is readable by any script on the origin.

The requirement (sections 15-16) is a *remembered* session that survives a tab close, a browser
restart and an access-token renewal on the same browser, WITHOUT a second OTP, for as long as the
session is valid. The deliberate way to do that is NOT to move the refresh token into web storage -
that keeps the renewal working but makes the worse exposure permanent. It is to hold the tokens on
the server and hand the browser only an **opaque session id** in a `Secure; HttpOnly; host-only`
cookie. Script on the page cannot read an HttpOnly cookie, the id names nothing on its own, and the
server is the only thing that can exchange it for a live access token.

This module is the server-side custody. It is pure in the sense `payment_attempt` and
`checkout_pricing` are: every function takes an injected `store` and an injected clock, holds no AWS
client, and never reaches the network itself - so it imports with no credentials and is tested
offline. The one place a Cognito call is unavoidable (refresh) takes an injected callable, so the
test drives it without boto.

The custody model, stated precisely
------------------------------------
A session row holds, keyed by a **hash** of the opaque id (never the id itself - a leaked table
read must not yield usable session ids):

    sidHash            sha256 of the opaque session id. The row key.
    customerId         who this session is for. Authorises nothing on its own; see customer_auth.
    refreshRef         a REFERENCE to the Cognito refresh token in Secrets Manager, never the token.
    createdAt          absolute-deadline anchor. A refresh does NOT move this.
    absoluteExpiresAt  createdAt + 30 days. Hard cap. A refresh may not extend it.
    idleExpiresAt      lastSeenAt + 7 days. Every validated request moves this forward.
    lastSeenAt         touched on each validation.
    csrfToken          the double-submit secret for cookie-authenticated mutations.
    persistent         False for a shared-device sign-in: the cookie is a session cookie and the
                       absolute deadline is short. True for "remember me".
    rotationEnabled     whether the app client rotates refresh tokens; decides the refresh flow.
    revokedAt          set on sign-out. A revoked session validates to nothing, forever.

Why the deadlines are enforced here and not in the cookie
---------------------------------------------------------
A cookie `Max-Age` is a hint the browser may ignore and an attacker will. Idle and absolute expiry
are checked against the stored row on every validation, so a replayed cookie past either deadline is
refused regardless of what the browser did. The rule section 16 is specific about - *a successful
refresh must not extend the absolute deadline* - is why `absoluteExpiresAt` is anchored to
`createdAt` and the refresh path never touches it: without that, a session that refreshes every hour
lives forever, which is exactly the indefinite remembered-login this is meant to bound.

Rotation vs REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH
------------------------------
For a rotation-enabled app client the only correct refresh is `GetTokensFromRefreshToken`, which
returns a NEW refresh token that must replace the stored reference; `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` is
incompatible with rotation and would fail. For a non-rotation client `REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH` is correct
and the refresh token is reused. Which flow a client needs is a property of the DEPLOYED app client,
and inspecting it (`aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool-client`) is BLOCKED here - no AWS. So the
flow is a parameter of the session, defaulted conservatively, and the live decision is recorded as
an unblock step in the IaC note (see `customer_session_config.py`).

    `lambda_utils/response.py::cors_headers` sets no `Cache-Control` at all. These responses do not
    reach the browser directly either: the Amplify rewrite serves `/api/<*>` with status 200, so a
    shared cache sits in front of them. A cache that stored one customer's session response and
    replayed it to another would hand over that customer's CSRF token - and the token is exactly
    what `build_set_cookie`'s deliberate `SameSite=Lax` choice relies on to guard the mutations Lax
    still permits. Losing the token's secrecy therefore does not degrade the defence, it removes it.

    `response.py` is deliberately NOT changed to do this globally: `core/contacts/handler.py:285`
    removed `Cache-Control` on purpose, so a blanket header there would override a considered
    decision in an unrelated handler. The contract lives here, beside the session it protects, and
    each owning handler opts in.

    Returns a NEW dict; the input is never mutated, and anything already set on it - including a
    `Set-Cookie` or a caller's own `Cache-Control` - is preserved except that the no-store pair
    wins. A weaker `Cache-Control` on a session response is a bug, not a preference.
