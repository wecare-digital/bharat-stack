"""Lambda@Edge origin-response: send non-matching /get links to the main domain.

Why this exists as Lambda@Edge and not a CloudFront Function
------------------------------------------------------------
``wecare.digital/get/<key>`` is an Amplify 200-rewrite onto CloudFront
distribution ``E2GP22R4BIFGQ3``, whose origin is the private S3 bucket
``wecare-digital-get`` behind OAC. Because the bucket policy grants only
``s3:GetObject`` and never ``s3:ListBucket``, S3 answers **403 AccessDenied**
for a key that does not exist - it deliberately will not confirm absence.

Two cheaper mechanisms were tried first and both are structurally incapable:

1. **CloudFront custom error responses** can map 403 to a page, but the allowed
   ``ResponseCode`` values are 200/4xx/5xx only. They cannot emit a 3xx, so they
   cannot redirect.
2. **A CloudFront Function on viewer-response** cannot run at all here:
   "CloudFront doesn't invoke edge functions for viewer response events when the
   origin returns HTTP status code 400 or higher."
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-function-restrictions-all.html
   Verified empirically - routing the 403 through a custom error response with
   ``ResponseCode 200`` still did not invoke it, because the restriction keys off
   the *origin's* status, not the status CloudFront finally returns.

Lambda@Edge **origin-response** is the one trigger that fires for origin
responses of 400 and above, so it is the only place a true 302 can be produced.

It runs on cache misses only. CloudFront then caches the 302 we return, so the
steady-state cost of a bad link is a cache hit, not an invocation.

Constraints this file must respect
----------------------------------
* No environment variables - Lambda@Edge forbids them. The redirect target is
  therefore a module constant.
* Must be published as a numbered version; ``$LATEST`` cannot be associated.
* Deployed only to ``us-east-1``.

def _redirect(response: dict) -> dict:
    """Turn the origin's error response into a 302, mutating it in place.

    **Do not build a fresh response dict here.** ``Via`` and ``Transfer-Encoding``
    are read-only in origin-response events, and returning a new object *deletes*
    them - which counts as changing a read-only header. CloudFront then rejects
    the result with ``x-cache: LambdaValidationError`` and serves the viewer a
    502, while the Lambda logs stay completely clean because the function itself
    succeeded. That combination is very hard to read backwards, hence this note.

    So: keep the origin's header dict and add to it.

    The origin's error body (S3's ``AccessDenied`` XML) is left attached, along
    with its matching ``Content-Length`` and ``Content-Type``. Clients follow the
    ``Location`` and discard the body, and leaving the three consistent avoids a
    length mismatch.

    ``Cache-Control: no-store`` targets the browser, not CloudFront: a visitor
    should not hold this redirect if the file is later uploaded under the same key.
