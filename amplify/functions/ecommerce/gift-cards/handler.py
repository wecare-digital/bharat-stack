"""`wecare-gift-cards` - issuance, the staff view, and a customer balance check. FIVE routes.

Design reference: `.agents/tasks/wix-coupons-giftcards-20261001/gift-cards-service-plugin-20261001.md`
sections 5.3 (the code never appears in a URL), 6 (data model), 7.2 (our own routes) and 10.1 (the
scoped role).

| Route | Identity | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /gift-cards` | staff | Issue a card. Generates the code and returns it **once**. |
| `GET /gift-cards/{giftCardId}` | staff | By OUR id. Never by code, never a code in the response. |
| `GET /gift-cards` | staff | List by `status`, with the outstanding liability. |
| `POST /gift-cards/{giftCardId}/disable` | staff | `status=DISABLED`. Never deletes. |
| `POST /gift-cards/balance` | customer session | `{code, pin?}` in the BODY. Balance only. |

FIVE ROUTES, NOT SEVEN - AND THE TWO MISSING ONES ARE A DECISION (MEDIUM-5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
`POST /gift-cards/hold` and `POST /gift-cards/release` are deliberately absent. A customer session
has no `paymentAttemptId` - our checkout producers mint one, and nothing a browser can reach does -
so a hold taken from a customer route would either have to invent a key or be keyed on something
that is not the claim key. Worse, a hold taken OUTSIDE the request that mints the attempt skips the
`GC_HELD` stage, which leaves `giftCardRequiredPaise` unwritten; `is_fully_settled` then reads
`required == 0` and settles a gift-card order on the Razorpay leg alone. That is the exact failure
DECISION 3 exists to prevent, so the route is not provided rather than provided-and-guarded.

The hold is taken only by the checkout producer, inside the request that mints the attempt
(SEAM-G4 / SEAM-G14). The customer surface here is `POST /gift-cards/balance`, which reserves
nothing.

NO CODE IN A PATH OR A QUERY, EVER
----------------------------------
A bearer value in a URL lands in access logs, in `Referer` headers and in browser history. The
customer route takes `{code, pin?}` in the body; the staff reads take OUR `giftCardId`. Enforced by
SHAPE - no route template accepts a code - and asserted by a route-enumeration test, not by
convention. Wix's own `GiftCard.obfuscatedCode` masks the code on its side too, which is
corroboration rather than our rule.

There is no `DELETE`. A disabled card retains its liability record.

AUTHORIZATION, STATED RATHER THAN READ OFF THE GATEWAY
------------------------------------------------------
All five routes are created with `AuthorizationType=NONE` and no authorizer, because this account
has zero API Gateway authorizers across 361 routes and this change does not introduce the first one.
Authentication is `middleware.require_auth` INSIDE the handler on the four staff routes and a
customer-session resolution on the one customer route, before any table access.
`00-current-owner-overrides.md` records why the gateway field cannot be read as the answer: it
cannot distinguish an intentionally public signed webhook from an accidentally public API.

With WAF removed there is no per-IP layer in front of `POST /gift-cards/balance`, which is the one
route a stranger could grind to discover live codes. So it additionally goes through
`rate_limit.check_rate_limit` per session, and every refusal - malformed code, unknown code, wrong
PIN - answers identically.
