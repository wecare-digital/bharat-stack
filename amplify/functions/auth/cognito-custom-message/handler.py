"""Cognito CustomMessage trigger - branded HTML for every email the pool sends.

WHY A LAMBDA AND NOT A SETTING
------------------------------
`EmailMfaConfiguration.Message` is the only place to change the MFA email without
code, and the API reference documents it as a plain template that must contain
`{####}`; it says nothing about HTML. The documented way to send HTML is this
trigger, whose `emailMessage` response parameter explicitly "can use HTML
formatting".

That HTML path has one hard precondition, and this pool meets it:

    Amazon Cognito can use the emailMessage parameter ONLY IF the
    EmailSendingAccount attribute of the user pool is DEVELOPER.

`EmailSendingAccount` is `DEVELOPER` here (SES, identity one@wecare.digital,
configuration set wecare-digital), so `emailMessage` and `emailSubject` are both
honoured. If anyone ever switches the pool back to `COGNITO_DEFAULT`, Cognito
answers `InvalidLambdaResponseException` and **sign-in email stops working** - so
that switch and this function are coupled.

THE CODE IS NEVER IN THIS FUNCTION
----------------------------------
`request.codeParameter` is a *placeholder* string, typically `{####}`, not the
real one-time code. Cognito substitutes the value after this function returns. So
there is no credential here to leak, and nothing below needs redacting - a
genuinely nice property of this trigger, and the reason logging is safe.

The placeholder is read from the request rather than hardcoded as `{####}`,
which the docs call out as best practice, because it is Cognito's to choose.
`CustomMessage_AdminCreateUser` additionally requires `usernameParameter` to
appear in the body, or the new user never learns their own username.

WHY EVERY TRIGGER SOURCE IS HANDLED, NOT JUST MFA
-------------------------------------------------
This trigger intercepts *all* pool email. Handling only the MFA source would
leave the rest falling through to Cognito's unstyled default, which is the
inconsistency being fixed. Each source also gets its own heading and intro, so
two messages arriving together are immediately distinguishable - the owner
reported receiving two emails and being unable to tell them apart.

EMAIL IS NOT THE BROWSER - the deliberate deviations from the design contract
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Values come from .kiro/steering/grahak-os-design.md, with four changes forced by
mail clients rather than chosen:

1. `rgba()` is replaced by its **composited hex equivalent on white**. Outlook's
   Word rendering engine does not support rgba, and would drop the declaration
   and fall back to unstyled black. Same colour, opaque:
       rgba(0,0,0,.95)  -> #0d0d0d   (255 * 0.05  = 12.75)
       rgba(0,0,0,.898) -> #1a1a1a   (255 * 0.102 = 26)   also the contract's own
                                      brand near-black, so this is exact
       rgba(0,0,0,.54)  -> #757575   (255 * 0.46  = 117)
2. `clamp()` is replaced by one fixed size. clamp() is unsupported across most
   mail clients, and an unsupported font-size leaves the heading at a default.
   32px is the bottom of the contract's section clamp, so it is a value the
   ladder already contains.
3. Tables and inline styles, not flex or a <style> block. Gmail strips <head>
   styles in forwarded mail and Outlook ignores flex, so a stylesheet-based
   layout collapses.
4. The body copy sits at 17px rather than the contract's 20px. 20px is the
   contract's single body level for a 1300px page; in a 600px email column it
   wraps to very few words per line. 17px is the contract's own pill/`.msg` size,
   so again not a new value.

Everything else is the contract as written: the Inter-first stack, #e5e7eb
hairlines, the #000 code panel at 14px radius with white monospace, lime #d1f470
with #1a3a2a type for our own mark, and the 20px radius static card.
