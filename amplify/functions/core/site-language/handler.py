"""WECARE.DIGITAL site language service.

Public website-facing text translation. The service discovers the language
catalogue from the provider at runtime; it does not keep a hardcoded one.

Routes (API Gateway HTTP API):
  GET  /site-language/languages   open - static catalogue, costs nothing per call
  POST /site-language/translate   requires an allowlisted Origin, see _origin_allowed

TWO ROUTES WERE REMOVED, not deprecated: GET /site-language/voices and
POST /site-language/tts. They drove Amazon Polly and had no consumer - the widget
dropped read-aloud once it was clear Polly has no voice for Tamil, Telugu,
Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam or Punjabi, so the button was
hidden for nearly every language this serves. They stayed live and billable
afterwards. See the note above the client constructors.

Translation results are cached in DynamoDB - but only where the same strings
recur. The cache key is the text, so it does nothing against a caller sending
novel text, which is why the Origin check on /translate matters more than it does.

Translation provider
--------------------
Google Cloud Translation v2 is preferred when a key is available, because its
Indic output is materially better than Amazon Translate's. Amazon Translate is
the automatic fallback.

The Google key is read from Secrets Manager AT RUNTIME and never leaves this
process: it is not an env var, not a build input, and never reaches the browser.
That is the whole reason this route exists as a server. A browser widget cannot
hold a key - anything shipped to the page is readable in devtools - so the page
posts here and this function holds the credential.

This replaces the Cloud Run relay the widget used to call
(wecare-translation-relay). That relay checked the Origin header, which stops
another website embedding it but not a plain HTTP client, and it billed a Google
project directly with no request cap. Here the same work sits behind the
per-route API Gateway throttle in scripts/deploy_site_language.py and the
DynamoDB cache below, which is what actually holds the bill down.

Only handler.py is packaged (see package() in scripts/deploy_site_language.py),
so there is no `requests` in the bundle - HTTP goes through urllib from stdlib.

    Is the caller a browser on one of our own pages?

    THIS IS THE CHECK THAT WAS MISSING, AND _origin ABOVE IS NOT IT. _origin only decides
    which value to put in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin RESPONSE header. That header is an
    instruction to a browser, and a browser is the only thing that honours it: it stops
    another website's JavaScript from READING our reply, and it stops nothing else. curl
    sends no Origin, receives the translation, and is billed to us.

    So the endpoint was an open proxy onto a metered Google API. Sized against the limits
    actually configured - 15 rps in scripts/deploy_site_language.py, 30,000 bytes per request
    in MAX_TOTAL_BYTES - that is 450,000 characters a second, which at Google's $20 per
    million is about $9 a second, or $32,000 an hour. The DynamoDB cache below does not help
    against it: the cache key is the text, and an attacker sending random text never repeats a
    key. The throttle caps the RATE but not the bill.

    A REQUEST WITH NO Origin HEADER IS REFUSED, and that is safe for the real client because
    the site and the API are different hosts - wecare.digital calling api.wecare.digital is
    cross-origin, so every browser attaches Origin to the POST. A same-origin request could
    legitimately omit it; there is no same-origin caller here.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It is not authentication and it is not a defence against a
    determined attacker, who can set any header they like. It removes the accidental and the
    casual - a script, a scraper, someone else's site hotlinking the endpoint - which is the
    traffic that actually produces a surprise invoice. Real protection is a budget alarm and
    per-IP WAF; both are account configuration, not code, and neither is in this repository.

    # INTENTIONALLY PUBLIC - do not add require_auth here.
    #
    # SupportWidget renders from pages/_app.tsx on every page including public
    # ones, so anonymous visitors must be able to list languages and request a
    # translation. Requiring a Cognito token would blank the language control for
    # every signed-out visitor - which is everyone the feature exists for.
    #
    # It also cannot work mechanically: this function is packaged standalone
    # (see scripts/deploy_all_lambdas.py) and does not bundle lambda_utils, so
    # importing the shared middleware fails the pre-upload import validation.
    # That validation is what caught this before it shipped.
    #
    # THE EXPOSURE IS COST, NOT DATA, AND THE OLD NOTE HERE UNDERSTATED IT.
    # It said the mitigation was per-route throttling and that this was "not yet
    # applied". Throttling IS applied - scripts/deploy_site_language.py sets 15
    # rps / burst 30 per route - but a rate cap is not a spend cap. At 15 rps
    # with MAX_TOTAL_BYTES of 30,000 the ceiling is 450,000 characters a second,
    # about $9/sec or $32,000/hour at Google's $20 per million, and the cache
    # cannot help because an attacker's text never repeats a key.
    #
    # So the billed route now requires an allowlisted Origin. See
    # _origin_allowed for why that is safe for the real client and what it does
    # and does not defend against. /languages stays open: it returns a static
    # catalogue, costs nothing per call and is what the widget needs before a
    # visitor has asked for anything.
