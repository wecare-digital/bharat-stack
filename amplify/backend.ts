/**
 * WECARE.DIGITAL Admin Platform Backend
 *
 * AWS Account: 775261844268
 * Region: us-east-1
 *
 * This backend defines:
 * - Auth: Cognito (existing user pool via referenceAuth)
 * - Data: DynamoDB (~58 tables via AppSync)
 * - Storage: S3 (existing bucket: app.wecare.digital)
 *
 * Additional CDK resources:
 * - SQS Queues (4): inbound-dlq, bulk-queue, bulk-dlq, outbound-dlq
 * - CloudWatch Alarms, Dashboard, Log Retention
 * - WAF Web ACL for webhook endpoints
 * - URL Shortener (r.wecare.digital): API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + Route53
 * - Durable Admin SEO audit/log storage and Lambda
 *
 * Lambda functions (42+ Python functions) are deployed separately
 * and already exist in AWS. They are not managed by Amplify Gen 2.

// ─── DynamoDB TTL Configuration ──────────────────────────────────────
// Enable TTL on tables that have expiresAt/ttl fields.
// Amplify Gen 2 doesn't support TTL natively, so we use CDK overrides.
// NOTE: TTL is also enforced directly on the physical tables via
// scripts/_fix_ddb_ttl.py (the CDK override below historically failed silently).
// RateLimitTracker is intentionally OMITTED: its only time field is 'lastUpdatedAt',
// which is NOT an expiry — enabling TTL on it would purge the entire table.

  // SmsAws, AirtelSMS, RcsMessages and AirtelC2C removed 2026-09-24 with their
  // model declarations. None had a table, so the `if ( table )` guard below made
  // every one of these four a no-op - the block read as if it were configuring
  // eight retention policies and was configuring four.

  RazorpayWebhookLog: 'expiresAt',
  // PayUWebhookLog removed 2026-09-20 with the model; PayU is retired and its
  // table was deleted from the account.
  // PSTN voice (Plivo). PstnCall, PstnCallEvent and PstnAgentPresence were
  // configured here until 2026-09-23. All three were removed along with their
  // declarations in data/resource.ts: none existed in the account, and nothing in
  // amplify/functions read or wrote them. A TTL entry for a model that has no
  // table is a no-op on the `if ( table )` guard below, so this block was quietly
  // configuring nothing.
  //
  // The dual-purpose presence clock survives where it is actually used: in
  // PstnSoftphoneSessions, whose expiresAt is both the DynamoDB TTL and the
  // availability cutoff, so an agent whose browser closed without signing out
  // stops being routable when the heartbeat goes stale rather than when DynamoDB
  // happens to sweep. See scripts/provision_pstn_softphone.py, which sets it.
  //
  // PstnNotificationDelivery was declared here and in data/resource.ts and
  // existed in none of the 66 live tables, so every claim against it raised
  // ClaimStoreUnavailable and the dial-events route answered 503 without
  // sending. Removed 2026-09-21 rather than materialised (NOTIF-STORE-001);
  // the replacement tables are provisioned and read back by
  // scripts/provision_notification_domain.py, which sets their own TTL.
  // ProviderDriftSnapshot had no table and no writer - the Plivo drift check in
  // .github/workflows/plivo-drift.yml compares and reports, it does not persist
  // snapshots. It was left declared pending a single retired-provider sweep
  // (item 9.2 in .kiro/work/phases-5-10/plan.md); removed 2026-09-24 with that
  // sweep, along with its model in data/resource.ts.
  //
  // PstnFlowVersion and PstnRecordingAudit were listed here as deliberately
  // TTL-free - immutable routing history, and an audit record that must outlive
  // the audio it describes. Both reasons are sound and both are moot: neither
  // model had a table, and both declarations were removed on 2026-09-23. The
  // reasoning is kept in data/resource.ts so it is available if either is ever
  // built, rather than as a comment about a model that no longer exists.
